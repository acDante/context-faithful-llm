The American withdrawal in 2021 means that the countries of the region will have to play a greater role in the management of their borders and confront questions about their capacity to stop potentially destabilising trends emerging from Afghanistan, reported the Afghan Diaspora Network.\nHeroin networks and drug lords present a principal impediment to security, state-building, and democratic governance. Beyond the national boundaries, Afghan-originated heroin creates enormous challenges for international security by financing terrorism, instigating corruption, killing nearly 100,000 users worldwide every year, undermining public order, and debilitating economic development.\nThe devastating impacts of the Afghan heroin trade have spilled over into Southwest Asia, Central Asia, Russia, China, the Balkans, and Europe.The Taliban have long used narcotics as their main source of revenue. Without the poppy crop, they may never have grown to be the massive organisation that they are today that was capable of toppling the Ghani government, reported the Afghan Diaspora Network.\nAccording to the Narco-Insecurity, Inc.s report, The Convergence of the Narcotics Underworld and Extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Their Global Proliferation, this was made possible with the help of Pakistan's ISI, who launched several covert operations with sympathetic jihadist groups, all of whom relied heavily on narcotics trafficking to fund their operations, expanding the trafficking route even further through their regions, launching the Balkan, northern, and southern routes of the global narco-trafficking pipeline.\nThe most substantial of these was the Haqqani network, a criminal enterprise situated along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border that was founded on smuggling. The ISI saw the Haqqani network as a key ally, given their location and alliances with numerous jihadist groups, and began investing in their bases while using them as a proxy for engagement with other non-state actors.\nA vicious cycle has formed between insecurity and the opium economy. Insecure regions are fertile territory for poppy farming due to a lack of government oversight and a lack of alternative livelihoods. They both attract insurgent groups, who profit off of the opium industry at multiple levels of the supply chain and are created by insurgent groups.\nSince the recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, there has been a knock-on effect on the global narcotics industry. Counter narcotics efforts will need to shift to operate under a new paradigm where direct counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan are unlikely to continue.\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE\nYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

She went on trial last week and her next hearing is set for Thursday. If convicted on drug charges, she could face up to 10 years in prison. Griner sent Biden a letter this week, telling him she was \"terrified might be here forever.\"\nSpeaking with Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, Biden read a draft of the letter he is sending to the basketball player on Wednesday, the White House said. \"The President called Cherelle to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney's release as soon as possible, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and around the world,\" the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.\nBiden was joined in the call by Vice President Kamala Harris. He directed his team to remain in regular contact with Griner's family and with the families of other Americans detained abroad, the White House added. Whelan is a former U.S. Marine who was sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges in June 2020.\nGriner's case has drawn heightened attention amid Russia's war in Ukraine. Western powers have imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine, and Russian-U.S. relations have hit their worst point since the Cold War. At her first hearing on Friday, Griner was told she had been charged with intentionally importing narcotics. Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Griner may appeal her sentence or apply for clemency once a verdict is delivered.\nThe \"court must first deliver its verdict, but no one is stopping Brittney Griner from making use of the appeal procedure,\" Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Alexei Zaitsev said in a briefing. \"Attempts to present the case as though the American woman was illegally detained do not stand up to criticism,\" Zaitsev added.",
