The American withdrawal in 2021 means that the countries of the region will have to play a greater role in the management of their borders and confront questions about their capacity to stop potentially destabilising trends emerging from Afghanistan, reported the Afghan Diaspora Network.\nHeroin networks and drug lords present a principal impediment to security, state-building, and democratic governance. Beyond the national boundaries, Afghan-originated heroin creates enormous challenges for international security by financing terrorism, instigating corruption, killing nearly 100,000 users worldwide every year, undermining public order, and debilitating economic development.\nThe devastating impacts of the Afghan heroin trade have spilled over into Southwest Asia, Central Asia, Russia, China, the Balkans, and Europe.The Taliban have long used narcotics as their main source of revenue. Without the poppy crop, they may never have grown to be the massive organisation that they are today that was capable of toppling the Ghani government, reported the Afghan Diaspora Network.\nAccording to the Narco-Insecurity, Inc.s report, The Convergence of the Narcotics Underworld and Extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Their Global Proliferation, this was made possible with the help of Pakistan's ISI, who launched several covert operations with sympathetic jihadist groups, all of whom relied heavily on narcotics trafficking to fund their operations, expanding the trafficking route even further through their regions, launching the Balkan, northern, and southern routes of the global narco-trafficking pipeline.\nThe most substantial of these was the Haqqani network, a criminal enterprise situated along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border that was founded on smuggling. The ISI saw the Haqqani network as a key ally, given their location and alliances with numerous jihadist groups, and began investing in their bases while using them as a proxy for engagement with other non-state actors.\nA vicious cycle has formed between insecurity and the opium economy. Insecure regions are fertile territory for poppy farming due to a lack of government oversight and a lack of alternative livelihoods. They both attract insurgent groups, who profit off of the opium industry at multiple levels of the supply chain and are created by insurgent groups.\nSince the recent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, there has been a knock-on effect on the global narcotics industry. Counter narcotics efforts will need to shift to operate under a new paradigm where direct counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan are unlikely to continue.\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE\nYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

She went on trial last week and her next hearing is set for Thursday. If convicted on drug charges, she could face up to 10 years in prison. Griner sent Biden a letter this week, telling him she was \"terrified might be here forever.\"\nSpeaking with Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, Biden read a draft of the letter he is sending to the basketball player on Wednesday, the White House said. \"The President called Cherelle to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney's release as soon as possible, as well as the release of Paul Whelan and other U.S. nationals who are wrongfully detained or held hostage in Russia and around the world,\" the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.\nBiden was joined in the call by Vice President Kamala Harris. He directed his team to remain in regular contact with Griner's family and with the families of other Americans detained abroad, the White House added. Whelan is a former U.S. Marine who was sentenced to 16 years on espionage charges in June 2020.\nGriner's case has drawn heightened attention amid Russia's war in Ukraine. Western powers have imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine, and Russian-U.S. relations have hit their worst point since the Cold War. At her first hearing on Friday, Griner was told she had been charged with intentionally importing narcotics. Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Griner may appeal her sentence or apply for clemency once a verdict is delivered.\nThe \"court must first deliver its verdict, but no one is stopping Brittney Griner from making use of the appeal procedure,\" Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Alexei Zaitsev said in a briefing. \"Attempts to present the case as though the American woman was illegally detained do not stand up to criticism,\" Zaitsev added.",

He was 77.\n\u201cAlthough this is a very sad day, I have comfort and peace that he is in a better place. He was the best Dad anyone could ask for. He was my coach, my mentor, my voice of reason, my best friend, my best man in my wedding, and my hero,\u201d Christopher Dow said, according to a statement that Bilotta shared on Tony Dow\u2019s official Facebook page.\nNews of the actor\u2019s passing comes one day after a premature announcement of his death. Dow revealed in May he had been diagnosed with cancer and was receiving hospice care this week, according to his son.\nDow was thrust into stardom at age 12, when he was cast on the soon-to-be-smash sitcom \u201cLeave It to Beaver.\u201d In the role, Dow helped create the archetype of a suburban nuclear family and became a household name to millions of viewers. The show ran from 1957 to 1963.\nIn a January interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Dow recalled learning over a hamburger and malt that he was offered the part after auditioning on a whim.\n\u201cThere went my life,\u201d he said.\nWally Cleaver, the straight-arrow teenage son, star athlete and Boy Scout, became inextricably tied to Dow, who said he struggled to stand on his own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to be famous at 12 years old or something, and then you grow up and become a real person, and nothing\u2019s happened for you,\u201d he told CBS.\nDow, who said he experienced undiagnosed depression from age 20 to age 40, spoke out for decades about his mental health challenges, long before it was common for celebrities to disclose that information publicly. In 1993, he was an honorary speaker at a convention for the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association.\n\u201cI realize there\u2019s a perceived irony about this,\u201d he told the Baltimore Sun of his depression in 1993. \u201cYou know, the fact that I was in a TV program that epitomized the supposed ideal world of the \u201950s, and here I\u2019m suffering from depression. But I\u2019m just one of millions.\u201d\nDow told CBS that once he accepted his diagnosis and began treatment, he found hope. He channeled that hope into art, too, sculpting ornate pieces at his home studio.\n\u201cI think people should take the leap of faith that they can feel better,\u201d he said.\nDow continued to work in Hollywood, taking parts in TV series and even reprising his role in \u201cThe New Leave It to Beaver\u201d in the 1980s. He also directed episodes of series like \u201cHarry and the Hendersons,\u201d \u201cCoach\u201d and \u201cStar Trek: Deep Space Nine.\u201d\nJerry Mathers, who starred opposite Dow as Beaver on their hit sitcom, told fans earlier this month that he\u2019d been in contact with Dow, whose managers said had been \u201cin and out of the hospital with various complications and treatments.\u201d\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Aldrich\u201d in motions filed on their behalf and stated in footnotes that Aldrich is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns.\nThe motions pertain to the unsealing of documents and evidence gathering and did not expand on Aldrich\u2019s gender identity.\nOfficials have said Aldrich, who has not been formally charged yet, has been preliminarily charged with five counts of murder and five counts of a bias-motivated crime, but the charges are not final.\nThe nightclub where the attack occurred, Club Q, is locally known to be a haven for the LGBTQ community in the mostly conservative city of Colorado Springs.\nAldrich previously used the name Nicholas Franklin Brink until 2016 but petitioned a Texas court for a name change weeks before they turned 16. The defense said Aldrich requested the name change to \u201cprotect himself\u201d from a father, who reportedly had a criminal history that included domestic violence against Aldrich\u2019s mother.\nThe Washington Post first reported the name change.\nAldrich was taken to a hospital after two patrons reportedly subdued them and beat them with the gun they were using in the shooting. They were released from the hospital on Tuesday and taken to jail in El Paso County, where Colorado Springs is located.\nAldrich was arrested last year after their mother reported that they threatened her with a bomb and other weapons.\nSome advocates have raised questions about why Colorado\u2019s red flag law was not used to take Aldrich\u2019s weapons away after the incident.

        "article": "LONDON \u2014 Prince William and British politicians joined in memorial services Tuesday to mark five years since 72 people died in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower blaze, the worst domestic fire on British soil since World War II.\nWilliam and his wife, Kate, participated in a multi-faith service in the shadow of the high-rise apartment tower in west London. They observed a 72-second silence in memory of the 72 victims of the fire, and green balloons were released in memory of the 18 children who perished.\nHundreds of people marched in silence around the tower after the service as rows of London firefighters lined the road in a show of solidarity.\nEarlier Tuesday, former Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined survivors and the bereaved at a Westminster Abbey memorial service. As religious leaders read out the names of those who died, the congregation said in unison: \u201cForever in our hearts.\u201d\nRev. David Hoyle, the dean of Westminster, told the memorial service that five years on, the loss and anguish was \u201cstill vivid and sharp.\u201d\nThe June 14, 2017 inferno at Grenfell Tower, a public housing building set in Britain\u2019s richest borough of Kensington and Chelsea, horrified the nation and prompted many questions about lax safety regulations and other failings by officials and businesses that contributed to so many deaths.\nThe fire broke out in the middle of the night in a kitchen on the fourth floor of the tower and spread rapidly up the outside of the 25-story building like a lit fuse. Flammable cladding panels installed on the tower\u2019s exterior walls have been blamed for how the fire raced out of control.\nA public inquiry has been conducting a years-long investigation into the disaster, and a large police investigation is also ongoing. No one has been charged, and police have said there will be no prosecutions until the public inquiry is completed.\nThat has frustrated many survivors and bereaved families. The Rev. Graham Tomlin, bishop of Kensington, said many families cannot move on until they find justice.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t find any sense of acceptance or integration of what\u2019s happened in their lives,\u201d he told Times Radio. \u201cThey can\u2019t rebuild their lives until there\u2019s a sense of justice, because people feel that something deeply wrong went on at Grenfell and yet no one has been held responsible for it.\u201d\nLast month the British government banned metal composite cladding panels for all new buildings.\nOfficials have also issued new safety regulations requiring similar dangerous cladding to be removed from tower blocks across the country. But it\u2019s an expensive job and the work hasn\u2019t been carried out on some apartment buildings because of wrangling over who should pay.",

Police identified the driver as a German-Armenian man, whose vehicle eventually crashed into a shop window. He was detained by bystanders and handed over to the authorities. The injured included schoolchildren.\nPolice said it was unclear whether it was an accident or a deliberate act in a street near to the war-ravaged Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, one of the German capital's best-known landmarks. Officials said an investigation was ongoing and denied a report by Germany's Bild newspaper the driver had left a letter of confession in the car. Instead, investigators had found posters about Turkey, which has troubled relations with Armenia.\n\"We haven't clarified everything yet,\" Berlin's mayor Franziska Giffey told reporters at the scene. A police spokesperson at the scene said a dozen people were injured. Six were in a life-threatening condition, and another three were seriously hurt, the fire service said.\n\"It is too early to speculate\" about what caused the incident, an Interior Ministry spokesperson earlier told a regular federal government news conference in Berlin. The incident revived memories of 2016, when a man in the same area of Berlin hijacked a truck, killed the driver and drove into a crowded Christmas market and killed 11 more people.\nInvestigators were looking into whether the incident was a deliberate attack or possibly an accident with a medical cause, a police spokesperson said earlier, adding that the driver had received some medical treatment after the crash. Bild newspaper released a picture of the driver being detained, wearing a yellow pullover, jogging trousers and red trainers.\nMore than 100 emergency workers swarmed the scene after the incident. The small silver Renault car was lodged inside a shop after smashing through a plate glass display, Reuters images showed. Blankets covered what appeared to be a body in a cordoned-off area guarded by police. Rescue workers moved apparently conscious people on stretchers towards an ambulance, including one woman sitting up, and another who covered her face with her hand.\n\"I heard the bang and the crash when we were in a store, and then we came out and we just saw the carnage,\" John Barrowman, an actor, said in a video posted on his Twitter account. The site, on a shopping street near a McDonald's restaurant, was cordoned off. Bystanders looked up at a helicopter circling above.\nThe nearby Europa Center complex was later evacuated in case the crashed car contained explosives, police said. \"The federal government has of course learned of this terrible incident in Berlin today and is very concerned and distressed about it,\" a government spokesperson said. \"Our thoughts, our sympathy are with the injured and their relatives.\"\nThe incident took place near the scene of the attack on Dec. 19, 2016, when Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, plowed a truck into a crowded western Berlin Christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others. Amri then fled to Italy, where Italian police shot him dead.\nA police spokesperson said that police had learned from the experience in 2016 in dealing with Wednesday's incident. \"The wounds of 2016 are not healed, everyone remembers it,\" police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said.",

Gadsden City Schools Superintendent Tony Reddick told reporters that a \"potential intruder\" went to several doors trying to get into Walnut Park Elementary School, where a summer literacy program was being conducted for 34 children, the AP reports. All the exterior doors were locked, and the principal contacted the school resource officer when she realized what was happening, Reddick said.\nThe resource officer confronted a person who attempted to break into a marked Rainbow City police car near the school, according to a statement from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. More officers from the Gadsden Police Department showed up to assist, the statement said. The person was shot to death after resisting and trying to take the resource officer's gun, the agency said.

The state identified the dead man as Robert Tyler White, 32, of Bunnlevel, North Carolina. Officials don\u2019t know whether the man was a passerby or something else, Reddick said.\nAuthorities didn\u2019t immediately release details including whether White was armed or why he might have been trying to get into the school or patrol car. While the resource officer suffered minor injuries, no students were hurt and most didn't realize anything unusual had happened, Reddick said. \"Our primary concern was just making sure that someone who wasn't authorized to be in our building does not enter and our kids are safe,\" he said.

Buzbee did not provide any details about the latest case.\nThe previous 22 lawsuits were filed in 2021, and two of those cases recently received national attention when two of the women were interviewed for a segment on HBO\u2019s Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.\nBoth women provided graphic details of their encounters with Watson, who was traded from Houston to Cleveland in March.

The only thing new about her contentions is the embellishment making them more extreme than prior versions. Deshaun\u2019s denial remains the same.\u201d\nWatson is also facing a possible suspension from the NFL, which is independently investigating his behavior to see if he violated the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy.\nLeague investigators recently met with Watson in Houston. It\u2019s not know if the league has completed its inquiry.\nWatson, who has been giving depositions in the lawsuits over the past month, is scheduled to be back on the field on Wednesday as the Browns continue their offseason team activities.\nWatson has not spoken to the media since his introductory news conference on March 25.

Kais Saied will not change anything. He only seeks to have all the powers,\u201d he said.\nUnder Saied\u2019s own rules for the referendum, no minimum level of participation among the 9.2 million registered voters is needed to approve the new constitution. He has only stipulated the constitution will come into effect once the final results are published, and has not said what happens if voters reject it.\nSaied has hailed the foundation of a new Tunisian republic to end years of political sclerosis and economic stagnation.\nHowever, while nearly all major political parties and civil society organisations have denounced his unilateral approach to rewriting the constitution and the legitimacy of the referendum, they have failed to build a united front.\nDisunity was visible in protests against Saied in recent days. The Islamist party Ennahda, the biggest in parliament, took part in a protest on Saturday. Civil society organisations and smaller parties held one on Friday. A party that backed the pre-revolution autocracy held its own on both days.\nThe protests attracted only small numbers, but rallies organised by Saied supporters have also had only modest attendance and there has been little sign of excitement around the campaign.\nMost Tunisians seem more focused on the dire economy and rising prices.\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST\nHowever, the economic decline since 2011 has left many people angry at the parties that have governed since the revolution and disillusioned with the political system they ran.\n\u201cI don\u2019t support Saied, but I will vote yes in the referendum because those protesting against it are the main cause of our problems for the past decade,\u201d said Mohammed, a Tripoli resident.\nOf the three parliamentary elections and two presidential elections since the revolution, the lowest turnout, of 41%, was in 2019 for the chamber that Saied has dissolved.\nA turnout on Monday far below that rate would further call into question the legitimacy of Saied\u2019s new constitution and his project to remake Tunisian politics.",

Gas flows through Nord Stream 1 are currently unchanged at 20%.\nThe newly announced maintenance shutdown raises additional concerns that Russia may cut off gas altogether in a bid to gain political leverage over Europe as it tries to increase storage levels for the winter.\nGermany recently announced that its gas storage facilities have reached 75% of capacity, two weeks ahead of the September 1 target date. The Germans have now been urged to cut back on gas use. So the country will have enough for next winter.\nOnce the work is complete, Gazprom said, gas flow through Nord Stream 1 will resume at its previous level of 33 million cubic metres, or just 20% of the pipeline\u2019s capacity.\nGazprom said the routine maintenance will be carried out jointly with Siemens specialists, referring to its German partner Siemens Energy.\n_____\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Her lawyer said authorities allege she lied about those details for November or December of 2019, which is about the time they believe Harmony Montgomery went missing.\nKayla Montgomery waived arraignment on the charges and was released after spending the weekend in jail.\nShe was arrested Friday at the Manchester Police Department when she arrived for a daily check-in. The check-ins are required as part of Montgomery\u2019s bail conditions after she was arrested on unrelated charges of receiving stolen firearms.\nEarlier this year, she was charged with theft by deception after police said she falsely claimed that Harmony Montgomery was living with her in order to collect welfare benefits. She pleaded not guilty and was released on bail last month. Lawyers are scheduled to discuss that charge on Thursday.\nAuthorities didn't know that Harmony Montgomery was missing until last year. She is still considered a missing person. Her eighth birthday is Tuesday.\nKayla Montgomery pleaded not guilty to the benefits charge and was released on bail last month. In April, lawyers said a plea offer and a counter offer were discussed. A spokesperson for the attorney general's office said \u201cwe would not be able to comment\" when asked if the new charges would affect those discussions. Montgomery's attorney did not immediately respond.\nAdam Montgomery, Harmony\u2019s father, has been indicted on an assault charge alleging that he struck Harmony in the face in July 2019. He\u2019s also accused of unrelated firearms theft charges and has pleaded not guilty.\nThe couple, described as estranged, told police that Harmony was brought to be with her mother in Massachusetts around Thanksgiving 2019. Her mother said she last saw her daughter during a phone video conversation at around Easter that year.\nPolice have received hundreds of tips. They\u2019re offering $150,000 for information that will lead them to the missing child.",

        "article": "Lawyers for US basketball star Brittney Griner on Monday filed an appeal against her nine-year prison sentence, Russian news agencies have reported.\nGriner was convicted in Russia on August 4 of drug possession and smuggling and sentenced, in a politically charged case that could lead to a high-stakes prisoner exchange between Washington and Moscow.\nOn Monday, lawyer Maria Blagovolina was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying an appeal was filed, but the grounds of the appeal were not clear.\nBlagovolina and co-counsel Alexander Boykov had said after Griner's conviction that the nine-year sentence was excessive and that in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole.\nWhen sentenced, Griner, a two-time US Olympic champion and an eight-time all-star with the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, listened with a blank expression as an interpreter translated the verdict by Judge Anna Sotnikova, but her lawyers said later she was \"very upset.\" Griner also was fined one million rubles.\nUS President Joe Biden denounced as \"unacceptable\" the verdict and sentence, which came amid soaring tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine.\n\"I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends and team-mates,\" Biden said, adding that he would continue to work to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia on an espionage conviction.\nOutside court, the US Embassy's charge d'affaires Elizabeth Rood called the outcome \"a miscarriage of justice\".\nImage: Griner was escorted into the court room\nGriner, recognised as one of the greatest players in WNBA history, has been detained since February 17 after police said they found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage upon landing at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. She was returning to Russia, where she has competed since 2014.\nAs she was led out of court, Griner said: \"I love my family.\"\nThe nine-year sentence was close to the maximum of 10 years that Griner had faced under the charges. Most Russians possessing small quantities of drugs get at most five years in prison, lawyers said.\nDefence attorney Maria Blagovolina told reporters later that Griner was \"very upset, very stressed. She can hardly talk. It's a difficult time for her\".\nBefore the unusually swift verdict was reached, an emotional Griner apologised to her family, team-mates and the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, where she plays in the WNBA off-season, \"for my mistake that I made and the embarrassment that I brought on them\".\nWith her voice cracking, she added: \"I hope in your ruling it does not end my life.\"\nAsked if Griner could ask for pardon from President Vladimir Putin, Blagovolina said they would consider every possibility, but the lawyers said they were not part of any discussions about a prisoner swap.\nGriner's agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas said the sentence \"was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn\". She added that she supported Biden's efforts \"to get a deal done\".\nImage: Griner is an eight-time WNBA All Star and two-time Olympic gold medallist\nA conviction is usually needed before arranging a prisoner exchange and also allows Griner to apply for a pardon. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last month the \"necessary judicial procedures\" must be completed before other steps can be taken.\nThe disclosure in July that the US government was seeking a prisoner swap involving Griner reflected the growing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to bring her home. The US State Department had earlier declared Griner to be \"wrongfully detained\" - a charge that Russia has sharply rejected.\nWhen she took the stand on July 7, Griner said: \"I would like to plead guilty on the charges against me. But I had no intention of breaking any Russian law.\" She added that she brought the vape canisters into Russia because she had packed in haste for her flight.\nGriner also described a confusing scene while being held at the airport, saying an interpreter provided by authorities translated only a fraction of what was being said to her and that officials told her to sign documents without explaining what they were. She also said she was not informed of her rights.\nHer lawyers introduced evidence that Griner was using the medicinal cannabis for chronic pain and injuries sustained during her career and included a letter from her doctor. Griner testified she was aware cannabis oil was outlawed in Russia and had not intended to break the law or \"plan to smuggle anything into Russia\".\nGriner's case and her nearly six months behind bars have raised strong criticism among her supporters in the United States, including her wife, Cherelle, that Biden was not doing enough to win her freedom.\nGriner sent a personal appeal to Biden, and more than 1,100 Black female leaders urged the administration to \"make a deal to get Brittney back home swiftly and safely and to meet with Brittney's wife Cherelle immediately\". Biden later called Cherelle Griner \"to reassure her that he is working to secure Brittney's release as soon as possible,\" the White House said on July 6.\nCherelle Griner, who also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris, later said she was \"grateful to the both of them for the time they spent with me and for the commitment they expressed to getting BG home,\" using her wife's initials.\nImage: Griner held up personal photos during the hearing\nOn July 27, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington has offered a deal to Russia aimed at bringing home Griner and Whelan in a sharp reversal of previous policy. Details of the proposal were not announced, though a person familiar with the matter said the US has offered to trade convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for Whelan and Griner. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\nRussian media have speculated repeatedly that Griner could be swapped for Bout, nicknamed 'the Merchant of Death', who is serving a 25-year sentence in the US after being convicted of conspiracy to kill US citizens and providing aid to a terrorist organisation. Russia has agitated for Bout's release for years.\nThe severity of Griner's sentence could give Russia leverage in a swap by increasing pressure on Washington to negotiate her release.\n\"I think that the harsher the sentence, the more pressure there will be on the Biden administration to make a deal, and obviously they like leveraging that pressure,\" Tom Firestone, a lawyer who formerly served as the resident legal adviser at the US Embassy in Moscow, said of the Russians before the sentence was imposed.\nEven with US-Russia relations at a low point, the two countries managed to arrange a swap in April of Trevor Reed, a former US Marine detained in Russia, for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and convicted drug trafficker serving a 20-year prison sentence in Connecticut.\nGriner's detention was made public only after Russian troops moved into Ukraine, as relations between Russia and the United States hit new lows after Washington led the West in bringing sanctions against Moscow.\nHer plight has been highlighted by supporters at home, including top athletes, especially after little news emerged about her initial weeks of detention in Russia, where she had limited access to US diplomats. It was only in May that the State Department designated her as wrongfully detained, moving her case under its Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, effectively the government's chief hostage negotiator.\nAt the ESPY Awards last month, soccer star Megan Rapinoe referred to Griner as \"a political prisoner\", and tennis great Billie Jean King said, \"First, bring BG home. Gotta do that.\"\nNBA Finals MVP Stephen Curry wore Griner's jersey under his track suit at the awards show and urged \"the entire global sports community to continue to stay energised on her behalf..\"\nGriner, a 6ft 9ins center, has 12 of the 15 regular season dunks in WNBA history and set the single-year record for blocks with 129 in 2014. She led the league in scoring twice. She was a two-time Associated Press college basketball player of the year and led Baylor to a 40-0 season and the 2012 NCAA title. She was the No 1 pick by Phoenix in the 2013 draft.\nThe commissioners of the WNBA and NBA called the verdict \"unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected. ... It is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home.\"",

        "article": "Updated June 29, 2022 at 5:25 PM ET\nPARIS \u2014 The lone survivor of a team of Islamic State extremists who terrorized Paris in 2015 was convicted Wednesday of murder and other charges and sentenced to life in prison without parole for the deadliest peacetime attacks in French history.\nThe special terrorism court also convicted 19 other men involved in the assault on the Bataclan concert hall, cafes and the national stadium, which killed 130 people and injured hundreds, some permanently maimed. It also led to intensified French military action against extremists abroad and a lasting shift in France's security posture at home.\nSurvivors and victims' families emerged from the packed courtroom dazed or exhausted after an excruciating nine-month trial that's been crucial in their quest for justice and closure.\nChief suspect Salah Abdeslam was found guilty of murder and attempted murder in relation to a terrorist enterprise. The court found that his explosives vest malfunctioned, dismissing his argument that he ditched the vest because he decided not to follow through with his part of the attack on the night of Nov. 13, 2015.\nThe other nine attackers either blew themselves up or were killed by police that night.\nAbdeslam, a 32-year-old Belgian, was given France's most severe sentence possible. The sentence of life without parole has only been pronounced four times in the country \u2014 for crimes related to rape and murder of minors. Neither he nor his lawyer spoke publicly after the verdict.\nOf the defendants besides Abdeslam, 18 were given various terrorism-related convictions, and one was convicted on a lesser fraud charge. Some were given life sentences; others walked free after being sentenced to time served.\nThey have 10 days to appeal. The sentences were broadly expected, and those present expressed little surprise; mainly, a bit of relief.\n\"I hope to be able to put the word 'victim' into the past,\" said Arthur Denouveaux, who survived the Bataclan massacre.\n\"When things like this happen you have no repair possible. That's why you have justice,\" he said, even if \"justice can't do everything.\"\nDuring the trial, Abdeslam initially proclaimed his radicalism but later appeared to evolve, weeping, apologizing to victims and pleading with judges to forgive his \"mistakes.\"\nFor months, the packed main chamber and 12 overflow rooms in the 13th century Justice Palace heard harrowing accounts by the victims, along with testimony from Abdeslam. The other defendants were largely accused of helping with logistics or transportation. At least one is accused of a direct role in the deadly March 2016 attacks in Brussels, which also was claimed by the Islamic State group.\nSurvivors and victims' family members got to speak in court\nThe trial was an opportunity for survivors and those mourning loved ones to recount the deeply personal horrors inflicted that night and to listen to details of countless acts of bravery, humanity and compassion among strangers. Some hoped for justice, but most just wanted tell the accused directly that they have been left irreparably scarred, but not broken.\n\"I feel like I've grown up\" thanks to the trial, said David Fritz Geoppinger, who was held hostage in the Bataclan. \"It's important as a victim to hear justice speak.\"\nFrance was changed in the wake of the attacks: Authorities declared a state of emergency and armed officers now constantly patrol public spaces. The violence sparked soul-searching among the French and Europeans, since most of the attackers were born and raised in France or Belgium. And they transformed forever the lives of all those who suffered losses or bore witness.\nPresiding judge Jean-Louis Peries said at the trial's outset that it belongs to \"international and national events of this century. \" France emerged from the state of emergency in 2017, after incorporating many of the harshest measures into law.\nFourteen of the defendants were in court, including Abdeslam. All but one of the six men convicted in absentia are presumed killed in Syria or Iraq; the other is in prison in Turkey.\nMost of the suspects were accused of helping create false identities, transporting the attackers back to Europe from Syria or providing them with money, phones, explosives or weapons. Abdeslam was the only defendant tried on several counts of murder and kidnapping as a member of a terrorist organization.\n\"Not everyone is a jihadi, but all of those you are judging accepted to take part in a terrorist group, either by conviction, cowardliness or greed,\" prosecutor Nicolas Braconnay told the court in closing arguments this month.\nSome defendants, including Abdeslam, said innocent civilians were targeted because of France's policies in the Middle East and hundreds of civilian deaths in Western airstrikes in Islamic State-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq.\nDuring his testimony, former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande dismissed claims that his government was at fault. The Paris attackers did not shoot, kill, maim and traumatize civilians because of religion, he said, but \"fanaticism and barbarism.\"\nThe night of the attack was a balmy Friday evening, with the city's bars and restaurants packed. At the Bataclan concert venue, the American band Eagles of Death Metal were playing to a full house. At the national stadium, a soccer match between France and Germany had just begun, attended by then-President Hollande and then-Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nThe sound of the first suicide bombing at 9:16 p.m. barely carried over the noise of the stadium's crowd. The second came four minutes later. A squad of gunmen opened fire at several bars and restaurants in another part of Paris.\nWorse was to follow. At 9:47 p.m., three more gunmen burst into the Bataclan, firing indiscriminately. Ninety people died within minutes. Hundreds were held hostage \u2013 some gravely injured \u2013 in the hall for hours before Hollande ordered it stormed.\nDuring closing arguments Monday, Abdelslam's lawyer Olivia Ronen told a panel of judges that her client shouldn't be convicted of murder because he was the only one in the group of attackers who didn't set off explosives to kill others that night.\n\"If a life sentence without hope for ever experiencing freedom again is pronounced, I fear we have lost a sense of proportion,\" Ronen said. She emphasized through the trial that she is \"not providing legitimacy to the attacks\" by defending her client in court.\nAbdeslam apologized to the victims at his final court appearance Monday, saying his remorse and sorrow is heartfelt and sincere. Listening to victims' accounts of \"so much suffering\" changed him, he said.\n\"I have made mistakes, it's true, but I am not a murderer,\" he said.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

He will close his career with a doubles match at the Laver Cup on Friday \u2014 perhaps alongside longtime rival Rafael Nadal.\nFederer said he is now at peace with the decision to walk away, which comes a few weeks after Serena Williams played what is expected to be her last match at the U.S. Open, and he wants this farewell to be a celebration.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want it to be a funeral,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI want it to be really happy and powerful and party mode.\u201d\nWearing a blue blazer with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a white polo shirt, Federer took questions for about a half-hour at the arena that will host the team competition founded by his management company.\nSwitzerland's Roger Federer gestures during a media conference ahead of the Laver Cup tennis tournament at the O2 in London, Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2022.

Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS/Kin Cheung Previous Next\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous going in, because I haven\u2019t played in so long,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I can be somewhat competitive.\u201d\nFederer, who announced last week via social media that he would be retiring after the Laver Cup, said it took him a bit to get used to the idea of stepping away from competition.\nBut it was something he understood he needed to do after running into setbacks in July during his rehabilitation from what was his third surgery on his right knee in about 1 1/2 years.\n\u201cYou try to go to the next level in training, and I could feel it was getting difficult. \u2026 Then, I guess, I was also getting more tired, because you have to put more effort into it to be able to sort of believe that it was going to turn around. You start getting too pessimistic. Then I also got a scan back, which wasn\u2019t what I wanted it to be,\u201d Federer explained. \u201cAt some point, you sit down and go, \u2018OK, we are at an intersection here, at a crossroad, and you have to take a turn. Which way is it?\u2019 I was not willing to go into the direction of: \u2018Let\u2019s risk it all.\u2019 I\u2019m not ready for that. I always said that was never my goal.\u201d\nAnd the hardest part came when he knew he needed to stop.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sad,\u201d Federer said, \u201cin the very moment when you realize, \u2018OK, this is the end.\u2019\u201d\nThe last procedure on his knee came shortly after a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz at Wimbledon in July 2021, which will go into the books as the last singles match of a superlative career that began in the 1990s and included 103 tournament titles, a Davis Cup championship for Switzerland, Olympic medals and hundreds of weeks at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\nIn his online farewell message last week, Federer referred to retirement as a \u201cbittersweet decision.\u201d\nHe was asked Wednesday what aspect was most bitter and what was most sweet.\n\u201cThe bitterness: You always want to play forever,\u201d he said. \u201cI love being out on court. I love playing against the guys. I love traveling. \u2026 It was all perfect. I love my career from every angle.\u201d\nAnd then he added: \u201cThe sweet part was that I know everybody has to do it at one point; everybody has to leave the game. It\u2019s been a great, great journey. For that, I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\nHe will play doubles for Team Europe against Team World on Day 1 of the event, then will give way to 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini for singles over the weekend. That plan was run by the ATP and both team captains, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg, Federer said.\nAs for his doubles partner for the last hurrah? Federer would not say definitively \u2014 he said that\u2019s up to Borg \u2014 but the not-so-hidden secret is that it is expected to be Nadal, who holds the men\u2019s record of 22 major championships.\nBack in February, when word emerged that Federer would be in London this week, he said Nadal messaged him last year suggesting they play doubles together again. They teamed up to win a doubles match during the first Laver Cup in 2017.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re able to possibly share the court one more time as a doubles pairing,\u201d Nadal said in February, \u201cthen this would be a truly special experience for us both at this stage in our careers.\u201d\nWhile other contemporaries of Federer and stars of the sport are on Team Europe, such as 21-time Slam champ Novak Djokovic and three-time major winner Andy Murray, the Federer vs. Nadal matchup will go down in history as among the greatest rivalries in tennis or any other sport.\nThey played each other 40 times in all, with 14 Grand Slam matchups. Nadal came out on top in their classic 2008 Wimbledon final, considered by some the greatest match in history; Federer won their last showdown, in the 2019 semifinals at the All England Club.\n\u201cIt could be quite, I don\u2019t know, a unique situation, if it were to happen,\u201d Federer said about the doubles pairing. \u201cFor us, as well, to go through a career that we both have had and to come out on the other side and being able to have a nice relationship, I think, is maybe a great message, as well, to not just tennis but sports and maybe even beyond.\u201d\nAs for his future?\nThe father of two sets of twins \u2014 girls 13, boys 8 \u2014 wouldn\u2019t say exactly what he has planned, other than a vacation, but he did say he would remain connected to tennis in some capacity.\nRecalling the way Borg stayed away from the sport for years after retiring, Federer sought to reassure his own fans by saying: \u201cI won\u2019t be a ghost.\u201d\n___\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Jean Carroll, a magazine columnist who says the Republican raped her in the mid-1990s in a department store dressing room.\nThe deposition \u2014 if it takes place as planned \u2014 will give Carroll's lawyers a chance to interrogate Trump about the assault allegations as well as statements he made in 2019 when she told her story publicly for the first time.\nTrump says Carroll's rape allegation is \u201ca hoax and a lie.\u201d\nHis legal team worked for years to delay his deposition in the lawsuit, which was filed when he was still president. A federal judge last week rejected Trump\u2019s request for another delay, saying he couldn't \u201crun the clock out on plaintiff\u2019s attempt to gain a remedy for what allegedly was a serious wrong.\u201d\nStay informed about local news and weather. Get the NBC Bay Area app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts.\nDetails of where, when and how Trump was to be questioned haven\u2019t been revealed by either his lawyers or Carroll\u2019s. Only the date has been revealed in court filings.\nTrump still appeared to be in Florida as of Wednesday morning.\nCarroll was to have been questioned by Trump's lawyers last Friday. Neither her attorneys nor Trump's have responded to questions about how that deposition went.\nAnything Trump says during his deposition could potentially be used as evidence in an upcoming civil trial. He hasn't faced any criminal charges related to Carroll's allegations and any prosecution is unlikely. The deadline for criminal charges over sexual assaults that occurred in the 1990s has long expired.\nSimilar legal deadlines also applied to civil lawsuits over sexual assault. As a result, Carroll chose to sue Trump for defamation over comments he made in 2019 when he denied any wrongdoing. She maintains his denials and attacks on her credibility and character damaged her reputation.\nHowever, New York lawmakers recently gave survivors of sexual violence a one-year window to sue their attackers over old assaults. Carroll's lawyer has told the court she intends to file such a suit against Trump after that window opens in late November.\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, was at the Harvard Institute of Politics Tuesday night and spoke about the timeline for a subpoena being issued to former President Donald Trump in connection with the Jan. 6 Committee's investigation into the Capitol Riot.\nAccording to Carroll's account, she bumped into Trump as the two were shopping at the Bergdorf Goodman store across Fifth Avenue from Trump Tower. At the time, Carroll was on television as the host of an advice program, \u201cAsk E. Jean.\u201d\nShe said the two engaged in friendly banter as she tried to help him pick out a gift. But when they were briefly alone in a dressing room, she said he pulled down her tights and raped her.\nIn a recent statement, Trump called that story \u201ca complete con job.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this woman, have no idea who she is, other than it seems she got a picture of me many years ago, with her husband, shaking my hand on a reception line at a celebrity charity event,\u201d Trump said.",

Among those that came out to contest, Umo Eno is the only aspirant who did not belong to any known group and has Akwa Ibom as his own group. The argument was that if you hand the state over to this one, you have it over to this or that group.\n\u201cAs the leader of the Ibibios and by extension Akwa Ibom State, I had the responsibility of presenting Pastor Umo Eno as the best to take over from Governor Udom Emmanuel. It was not a decision of one person, but collectively a decision of stakeholders.\u201d\nOn Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s position and willing acceptance on the endorsement of Pastor Eno by the stakeholders, Attah said having a successor who would not continue on the legacies of his predecessor could be detrimental to the future of a state.\n\u201cLagos State government has benefited largely from continuity, the reason is because If you pick a fight between the presence and the past, then you have lost the future.\n\u201cThat was why most of my legacy projects such as the Science Park and the University of Science and Technology were abandoned,\u201d he posited.\nHe maintained that Pastor Eno will bring his private sector zeal and energy into governance, and tasked the PDP governorship hopeful and other youthful leaders to be willing to consult past governors/leaders for ideas to make the state better.\n\u201cI do not think you are smarter than your fathers, have respect for the elders, listen to what they have to say. If we build on the past, then the future is limitless,\u201d he stressed.\nSpeaking on the ongoing certificate scandal on Pastor Eno, Obong Attah, who noted that the case was ongoing in court, however said the move was initiated by those who felt threatened by the PDP aspirant\u2019s emergence.\nHe regretted that Nigeria was not practicing a parliamentary system of government, where all who had indicated interest to govern the state could have formed part of a parliament, to bring their wealth of experiences to the development of the state.\nThe former President of the Nigerian Institute of Architects pointed out that the future of Akwa Ibom, as a state with minimal landmark for large scale agriculture lies in technology.\nAttah said such realisation, had necessitated his establishment of the University and Science Park, as well as sponsorship of 72 graduates who were projected as pioneer lecturers, for post graduate studies in Canada.",

Taiwan calls China's repeated nearby military activities \"grey zone\" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwanese forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwanese responses.\nThe latest Chinese mission included 17 fighters and six H-6 bombers, as well as electronic warfare, early warning, antisubmarine and aerial refuelling aircraft, Taiwan's defence ministry said. Some of the aircraft flew northeast of the Pratas, according to a map the ministry provided.\nHowever, the bombers, accompanied by an electronic warfare and an intelligence gathering aircraft, flew into the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines and into the Pacific, before turning back to China on the same route. Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems monitored them, the ministry said, using standard wording for its response.\nIt was the largest incursion since Taiwan reported 30 Chinese aircraft in its ADIZ on May 30. The largest to date this year occurred on Jan. 23, involving 39 aircraft. There was no immediate comment from China, which has in the past said that such moves were drills aimed at protecting the country's sovereignty.\nTaiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Wednesday the large-scale exercise by the Chinese military showed China's military threat is \"more serious than ever\". \"But there's no way #Taiwan will cave in & surrender its sovereignty & democracy to the big bully. Not a chance!,\" Wu said on Twitter.\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an email that Beijing should \"cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure and intimidation against Taiwan\". China launched its third aircraft carrier on Friday, the Fujian, named after the province opposite Taiwan.\nChina's military said last month it had conducted an exercise around Taiwan as a \"solemn warning\" against its \"collusion\" with the United States. That came after U.S. President Joe Biden angered China by appearing to signal a change in a U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" on Taiwan by saying the United States would get involved militarily if China were to attack the island.\nChina has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims. The Taipei government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked. No shots have been fired and the Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but in its ADIZ, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats.",

It is unjust for a child to leave like this,\u201d Antonis Tasios, secretary of the Roma community where the teenager lived, said Tuesday morning after the hospital announced the death. \u201cWe have great pain.\u201d\nThe boy had remained hospitalized in intensive care since undergoing emergency surgery. The hospital said he succumbed to his injury Tuesday morning despite the medical team's efforts. His funeral is to be held on Thursday.\nPolice in Thessaloniki said about 50 people emerged from a university campus Tuesday afternoon and threw several Molotov cocktails at a riot police unit stationed nearby. No injuries were reported.\nA police officer on a motorcycle shot the teenager during a pursuit after the youth filled up his pickup truck at a gas station and allegedly drove off without paying the 20-euro bill.\nPolice have said the teen, who has not been officially named, tried to ram the police motorbikes involved in the chase. The 34-year-old officer charged in the case said during an initial court appearance last week that he fired his weapon to stop the pickup truck because he feared for the lives of his colleagues, but that he had aimed at the tires, not the driver.\nThe Roma community has denounced the shooting as having racist motives. Several Roma men have been injured or fatally shot in recent years during confrontations with police while allegedly seeking to evade arrest for breaches of the law.\nMembers of the Roma community in Greece have long faced discrimination, and many often live on the margins of society.\nThe police officer accused of firing the fatal shot was suspended and has been under house arrest since Friday on a felony count of attempted manslaughter with possible intent and a misdemeanor count of illegally firing his weapon.\nIt is highly likely the felony charge will be amended to manslaughter due to the teen's death. A court decision on whether to jail or release the officer before trial is expected in the coming days.\nCitizens' Protection Minister Takis Theodorikakos, who has jurisdiction over Greek police, tweeted his \u201cdeep sorrow for the death of the 16-year-old boy\u201d and extended his condolences to the teenager's family.\n\u201cI repeat that this case is being investigated by the judicial system, which is the only one competent to assess the facts and judge responsibilities,\u201d the minister wrote. \u201cLet us all respect that.\u201d\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Microsoft has placed a large wager on Game Pass, claiming in January that it has 25 million members paying at least $10 per month.\nRather than competing on hardware with Sony Group Corp., the developer of the PlayStation, and Nintendo Co., Microsoft is attempting to build the Netflix of gaming \u2014 and is, by many accounts, close to achieving this goal.

This year, though, E3 was canceled, and other publishers like Ubisoft and Sony canceled their yearly presentations, leaving Microsoft with the sole slot on Sunday.\nGame Pass is also positioned by Microsoft as a service that will benefit games that are otherwise free.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addresses members of the Basij, the volunteer paramilitary wing of the elite Revolutionary Guards, and reiterates unsubstantiated claims that protesters demonstrating across the country are \u2018tools\u2019 of the United States and its \u201cmercenaries\u201d.\n\u201c(The) Basij must not forget that the main clash is with global arrogance, or the United States,\u201d Khamenei said in speech marking Basij week in Iran, echoing previous statements lambasting protests as a foreign plot to destabilize Iran.\nPraising the Basij\u2019s military and social virtues over the decades, Khamenei said the forces \u201csacrificed themselves to save people from a group of rioters and mercenaries\u201d, referring to recent unrest across the country. \u201cThey sacrificed themselves to confront oppression.\u201d\nThe Basij played a leading role in suppressing protests that began on September 17, sparked by the death of a young woman while in the custody of Iranian vice police. His death sparked months of protests against the country\u2019s compulsory headscarf, but quickly turned into one of the biggest challenges to Iran\u2019s theocracy since the chaotic years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nProtests continued on Saturday at some universities in the capital Tehran and other cities, according to social media. Due to a harsh nationwide crackdown by Iranian security forces, the protests have become more dispersed. Protesters have also called for trade strikes.\nKhamenei\u2019s comments came a day after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with a group of Basij members and praised their efforts to maintain security, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\nIran\u2019s fierce crackdown on dissent has drawn criticism, with at least 448 people killed and more than 18,000 arrested during protests and the violent response by security forces that followed, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group monitoring protests. Iran has not offered a toll or number of those arrested.\nIn a letter, 140 ophthalmologists raised concerns about the growing number of patients suffering serious eye damage resulting from being hit by metal pellets and rubber bullets, according to pro-reform Iranian news site Sobhema. and Iran International as well as other social media sites. \u201cUnfortunately, in many cases the blow caused the loss of sight in one or both eyes,\u201d reads the letter addressed to the head of the country\u2019s association of ophthalmologists.\nThe doctors asked the head of the Iranian Ophthalmology Association to convey their concerns about the irreparable damage caused by the security forces to the competent authorities.\nIt was the second letter from ophthalmologists expressing concern about police brutality and the firing of pellets and rubber bullets into the eyes of protesters and others. A previous letter was signed by more than 200 ophthalmologists.",

The company was valued at the time at $3.25 billion.\nIn a blog post, the company said it had frozen withdrawals, as well as transfers between accounts, \"to stabilise liquidity and operations while we take steps to preserve and protect assets.\"\n\"We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations.\"\nThe Celsius move puts the spotlight on the sustainability of crypto lending firms after a period of breakneck growth last year fuelled by low interest rates and booming crypto markets.\nThe surge of interest in crypto lending led to concerns from regulators, especially in the United States, who are worried about investor protections and systemic risks.\nMARKETS UNDER PRESSURE\nCrypto markets have come under pressure alongside stocks and other assets in financial markets amid rising interest rates and surging inflation. The collapse in May of the so-called stablecoin terraUSD and its sister token luna has also shaken the crypto industry.\nThe largest cryptocurrency bitcoin fell further after Celsius's announcement, dropping more than 7.8% to $24,502, its lowest since December 2020.\nEther, the second largest token, dropped as much as 12% to $1,245, its lowest since March 2021.\nMajor investors and venture capital firms bet heavily last year on the crypto lending sector.\nAs of May 17, Celsius Network had $11.8 billion in assets, its website said, down by more than half from October, and had processed a total of $8.2 billion worth of loans.\nCEO Alex Mashinsky was quoted in October last year saying Celsius had more than $25 billion in assets.\nMashinsky did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment outside U.S. business hours.\nIn a tweet on Monday, rival crypto lender Nexo said it had offered unspecified help to Celsius, but was refused.

The former guerrilla has pledged to stop awarding new oil exploration contracts, do a complete overhaul of the nation's pension system and increase tax on the rich and large landowners.\n\"Investors' concerns are justified and we expect Colombian markets to remain under pressure over the next few months,\" said Olga Yangol, head of emerging-market research and strategy at Credit Agricole CIB. \"Colombia's fiscal and external vulnerabilities make the country particularly vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment.\"\nSome of Petro's plans will be relatively simple to implement, such as firing the management of Colombia's state oil company. Other proposals, such as taxing wealthy landowners and declaring an economic state of emergency, will be constrained by powerful institutions such as congress and the constitutional court.\nMr Petro doesn't have a majority bloc in Congress.\nHis pick for finance minister will be key to appeasing investor concerns. Former presidential candidate for the centrist coalition Alejandro Gaviria has emerged as the favourite for markets, while other candidates include Jorge Garay, Rudolf Hommes, Jorge Ivan Gonzalez, Cecilia Lopez, Ricardo Bonilla and Luis Fernando Medina.\nSomeone close to Mr Petro's circle of advisers could trigger further market losses, according to Andres Pardo, chief Latin America macro strategist at XP Investments.\n\"It is likely that part of the overshoot reverses as Petro sooth the markets and appoints a market-friendly finance minister,\" said Mario Castro, a strategist at BBVA.\n\"In any case, COP will keep a premium going forward given the possibility of implementation of proposals such as the phase out of oil exploration which could have a negative impact on the external sector of the economy.\"",

Fauci, said people should be paying attention but not panicking. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Fauci recently told WTOP News that people do not need to change the way they live their lives but should monitor the situation and adjust behaviors as more information becomes available.\n\u201cYou never blow off any emerging infection when you don\u2019t know yet where it\u2019s going,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou pay attention to it. You follow it. Then you respond to it in an appropriate manner.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn fact, at least five children in the United States have contracted monkeypox within the past month \u2014 and more kids may have been recently exposed in Illinois.\nIllinois health authorities announced Friday that a person who works at a day-care center in Champaign County, tested positive for the virus, potentially exposing between 40 and 50 others, many of them children. Julie Pryde, administrator of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, wrote in a text message to The Washington Post on Friday night that several dozen children had been offered vaccines.\n\u201cDoes that mean that every parent in the country needs to be terrified that that\u2019s going to happen to their child? Of course not,\u201d Fauci told WTOP News. \u201cDon\u2019t brush it off as something we don\u2019t have to pay attention to. But don\u2019t panic about it.\u201d\nMonkeypox is spread through close \u2014 usually skin-to-skin \u2014 contact, or through contact with bodily fluids, including respiratory secretions. But a person can also contract monkeypox by touching surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches or tabletops, or by handling fabrics, such as clothing, bedding or towels, that have been used by someone infected with the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAdvertisement\nSymptoms include a rash that can present as bumps or blisters and that may itch or cause pain, as well as a fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and respiratory issues such as a sore throat, nasal congestion or cough, the CDC said.\nPatients usually recover within two to four weeks.\nThose who have symptoms should contact their health-care provider. Although there is no specific treatment, people who are considered high risk for complications may be given antiviral medication, the CDC said.\nHealth authorities recommend avoiding close contact with people who are experiencing symptoms and practicing good hygiene, such as hand-washing and hand-sanitizing. In addition, the CDC recommends that those who have had a known exposure get vaccinated.\nData suggests that the smallpox vaccine is about 85 percent effective against monkeypox, according to the CDC.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough the smallpox vaccine stopped being administered to the U.S. general public in the 1970s \u2014 years after the disease was eliminated in North America \u2014 a supply was kept on hand. A new vaccine, ACAM2000, replaced the old one in the mid-2000s. In 2019, Jynneos was approved to prevent smallpox and monkeypox in high-risk adults 18 and older. But supplies are limited.\nThe CDC recommends people get vaccinated within four days of exposure to prevent infection, but there may still be benefits up to 14 days. People in that situation should contact their doctor for guidance.\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

Many had waited for hours in line, including through cold nights, to attend the lying in state in an outpouring of collective grief and respect.\n\u201cI felt like I had to come and pay my final respects to our majestic queen. She has done so much for us and just a little thank you really from the people,\u201d said Tracy Dobson, who was among the last to join the line.\nMembers of the royal family, including King Charles III, second from left, and Princess Anne, third from left, and Prince William, first from left, and Prince Harry, third from left, are seen at the procession following the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday.\nIn a country known for pomp and pageantry, the first state funeral since Winston Churchill\u2019s was filled with spectacle: 142 Royal Navy sailors drew the gun carriage carrying Elizabeth\u2019s coffin to Westminster Abbey, with King Charles III and his sons, Princes William and Harry, walking behind as bagpipers played. Pall bearers carried the coffin into the abbey, where around 2,000 people ranging from world leaders to health care workers gathered to mourn her. Ahead of the service, a bell tolled 96 times \u2014 once a minute for each year of her life.\n\u201cHere, where Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the Commonwealth, and from the nations of the world, to mourn our loss, to remember her long life of selfless service, and in sure confidence to commit her to the mercy of God our maker and redeemer,\u201d the dean of the medieval abbey, David Hoyle, told the mourners, as the funeral opened.\nIt drew to a close with two minutes of silence observed across the United Kingdom.\nKing Charles III, Camilla, Queen Consort and other members of the Royal family follow the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II as it is carried into Westminster Abbey ahead of her State Funeral, in London, Monday Sept. 19, 2022. The Queen, who died aged 96 on Sept. 8, will be buried at Windsor alongside her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year.\nMonday has been declared a public holiday in honor of Elizabeth, who died Sept. 8 \u2014 and hundreds of thousands of people descended on central London to partake in the historic moment. Long before the service began, city authorities said viewing areas along the route of the funeral\u2019s procession were full.\nMillions more tuned into the funeral live on television, and crowds flocked to parks and public spaces across the U.K. to watch it on screens. Even the Google doodle turned a respectful black for the day.\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in his sermon that \u201cfew leaders receive the outpouring of love we have seen\u201d for Elizabeth.\nAfter the passage through central London, the coffin was placed in a hearse and headed for Windsor Castle \u2014 where Elizabeth spent much of her time. Mourners threw flowers at the convoy as it passed.\nThere will be another procession in Windsor before a committal service in St. George\u2019s Chapel. The queen will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\nOn the evening before, Charles issued a message of thanks to people in the U.K. and around the world, saying he and his wife Camilla, the queen consort, have been \u201cmoved beyond measure\u201d by the large numbers of people who have turned out to pay their respects to the queen.\nQueen Elizabeth II is mourned.\nPeople across Britain paused for a minute of silence at 8 p.m. Sunday in memory of the only monarch most have ever known. At Westminster Hall, the constant stream of mourners paused for 60 seconds as people observed the minute of reflection in deep silence.\nIn Windsor, rain began to fall as the crowd fell silent for the moment of reflection. Some camped overnight outside the castle in order to reserve the best spots to view the queen\u2019s coffin.\nJilly Fitzgerald, who was in Windsor, said there was a sense of community among the mourners as they prepared to wait hours to see procession carrying the queen\u2019s coffin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be with all the people who are all feeling the same. It\u2019s like a big family because everyone feels that \u2026 the queen was part of their family,\u201d she said.\nAutoplay Caption\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Sylvia Hui, Samya Kullab and David Keyton contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow AP coverage of Queen Elizabeth II at https://apnews.com/hub/queen-elizabeth-ii\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Sylvia Hui, Samya Kullab and David Keyton contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow AP coverage of Queen Elizabeth II at https://apnews.com/hub/queen-elizabeth-ii\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

The 19A adopted in 2015 pruned presidential powers by empowering Parliament above the executive president.\nWickremesinghe was the main sponsor of the 19th Amendment in 2015. However, 19A was scrapped after Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the November 2019 presidential election.\nSri Lankan MPs on July 20 elected Wickremesinghe as the country's new president, with the majority of the vote coming from lawmakers representing ousted President Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party.\nThere were only two non-SLPP lawmakers in the Cabinet appointed on Friday. Constitutionally, the Cabinet can be extended up to 30 members.\nThe 73-year-old President was appointed for the rest of the term of Rajapaksa who initially fled to the Maldives and then to Singapore. Rajapaksa is accused of mishandling the economic crisis, the worst since 1948.\nWickremesinghe was appointed prime minister by Rajapaksa in mid-May. He was tasked with reviving the economy by giving early solutions to fuel, cooking gas and power shortage problems, which triggered mass agitations against Rajapaksa.\nThe government declared bankruptcy in mid-April by refusing to honour its international debt. Wickremesinghe on Wednesday said his government\u2019s main priorities are to fix the country\u2019s ailing economy and end the severe fuel shortage that has exacerbated after the last shipment under the Indian credit line arrived in the country in June.",

The new boy made the most of the celebrations.\nThere were a few half-chances as halftime approached before Arsenal returned from the break with renewed intensity.\nGabriel Jesus found Odegaard with a cross from which he could not make a clean connection and Saka rifled across the face of goal as the visitors worked another opening. Tyrell Malacia\u2019s attempt to stop the latter ended in penalty appeals that were ignored.\nSaka\u2019s floated cross then landed on the crossbar as United remained under pressure.\nCristiano Ronaldo came on for Antony but in the 60th minute, Arsenal\u2019s pressure told.\nHaving intercepted the ball, the Gunners quickly launched an attack. Odegaard slipped in Jesus, with Dalot\u2019s tackle on him inadvertently putting the ball into Saka\u2019s path to strike.\nIt was no less than the league leaders deserved at that time but they were only level for six minutes.\nUnited picked up a loose pass and launched a break, with Fernandes\u2019 excellent ball putting Rashford through to hit a drive that beat Ramsdale and rippled the back of the net in front of the Stretford End.\nThe Arsenal goalkeeper batted away Fernandes\u2019 chip and, after Jesus went close at the other end, was picking the ball out of his net again in the 75th minute.\nFernandes superbly capitalized on the visitors\u2019 high line with a pass that put Eriksen free. The experienced midfielder squared the ball for Rashford to score his second.\nUnited moved up to fifth place, three points behind Arsenal.\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

When most of the votes were counted, they prevailed by about 20 percentage points, and the turnout was approaching typical for the autumn gubernatorial elections.\nThe vote also gave hope to Democrats across the country seeking to change the rules of the game during an election year otherwise filled with gloomy omens for their prospects in November.\n\u201cThis vote clarifies what we know: most Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and the right to make their own health care decisions,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement.\nCalling on Congress to \u201crestore Roe\u2019s protections\u201d in federal law, Biden added, \u201cAnd the American people should continue to use their voice to protect women\u2019s right to health care, including abortion.\u201d\nThe Kansas vote also served as a warning to Republicans, who welcomed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and moved quickly with bans or near bans on abortion in almost half of the states.\n\u201cKansans has categorically rejected attempts by anti-abortion politicians to create a reproductive police state,\u201d said Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity. \u201cToday\u2019s vote was a powerful rebuke and a promise of growing resistance.\u201d\nThe proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution would add language stating that it does not give the right to abortion. A 2019 State Supreme Court decision declared that access to abortion is a \u201cfundamental\u201d right under the state Bill of Rights, preventing prohibition and potentially undermining legislative efforts to impose new restrictions.\nThe referendum was closely watched as a barometer of liberal and moderate voter anger over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision abolishing the nationwide right to abortion. In Kansas, abortion opponents did not say what legislation they would apply if the amendment was passed, and were outraged when opponents predicted it would lead to a ban.\nMallory Carroll, a spokesperson for the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a national anti-abortion group, called the vote a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d for the movement and urged anti-abortion candidates to \u201cgo on the offensive.\u201d She added that after the ruling of the US Supreme Court, \u201cwe must work exponentially to ensure and maintain the protection of unborn children and their mothers.\u201d\nThe measure\u2019s failure was also significant because of Kansas\u2019 ties to anti-abortion activists. The \u201cSummer of Mercy\u201d anti-abortion protests in 1991 inspired abortion opponents to take over the Kansas Republican Party and made the Legislature more conservative. They were there because Dr. George Tiller\u2019s clinic was one of the few in the United States known to perform abortions in late pregnancy, and he was killed in 2009 by an anti-abortion extremist.\nAnti-abortion lawmakers wanted the vote to coincide with the August state preselection, claiming they wanted to make sure they would be the focus of attention, although others saw it as an obvious attempt to boost their chances of winning. Twice as many Republicans as Democrats voted in the August primaries in the state in the decade leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\u201cThis result is a temporary setback, and our selfless struggle for the value of women and children is far from over,\u201d said Emily Massey, a spokesperson for the Amendment campaign.",

        "article": "TOPEKA, Kan. -\nKansas voters on Tuesday sent a resounding message about their desire to protect abortion rights, rejecting a ballot measure in a conservative state with deep ties to the anti-abortion movement that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban the procedure outright.\nIt was the first test of voter sentiment after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June that overturned the constitutional right to abortion, providing an unexpected result with potential implications for the coming midterm elections.\nWhile it was just one state, the heavy turnout for an August primary that typically favours Republicans was a major victory for abortion rights advocates. With most of the vote counted, they were prevailing by roughly 20 percentage points, with the turnout approaching what's typical for a fall election for governor.\nThe vote also provided a dash of hope for Democrats nationwide grasping for a game-changer during an election year otherwise filled with dark omens for their prospects in November.\n\"This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions,\" U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement.\nAfter calling on Congress to \"restore the protections of Roe\" in federal law, Biden added, \"And, the American people must continue to use their voices to protect the right to women's health care, including abortion.\"\nThe Kansas vote also provided a warning to Republicans who had celebrated the Supreme Court ruling and were moving swiftly with abortion bans or near-bans in nearly half the states.\n\"Kansans bluntly rejected anti-abortion politicians' attempts at creating a reproductive police state,\" said Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity. \"Today's vote was a powerful rebuke and a promise of the mounting resistance.\"\nThe proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution would have added language stating that it does not grant the right to abortion. A 2019 state Supreme Court decision declared that access to abortion is a \"fundamental\" right under the state's Bill of Rights, preventing a ban and potentially thwarting legislative efforts to enact new restrictions.\nThe referendum was closely watched as a barometer of liberal and moderate voters' anger over the Supreme Court's ruling scrapping the nationwide right to abortion. In Kansas, abortion opponents wouldn't say what legislation they'd pursue if the amendment were passed and bristled when opponents predicted it would lead to a ban.\nMallory Carroll, a spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, described the vote as \"a huge disappointment\" for the movement and called on anti-abortion candidates to \"go on the offensive.\"\nShe added that after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, \"We must work exponentially harder to achieve and maintain protections for unborn children and their mothers.\"\nThe measure's failure also was significant because of Kansas' connections to anti-abortion activists. Anti-abortion \"Summer of Mercy\" protests in 1991 inspired abortion opponents to take over the Kansas Republican Party and make the Legislature more conservative. They were there because Dr. George Tiller's clinic was among the few in the U.S. known to do abortions late in pregnancy, and he was murdered in 2009 by an anti-abortion extremist.\nAnti-abortion lawmakers wanted to have the vote coincide with the state's August primary, arguing they wanted to make sure it got the focus, though others saw it as an obvious attempt to boost their chances of winning. Twice as many Republicans as Democrats have voted in the state's August primaries in the decade leading up to Tuesday's election.\n\"This outcome is a temporary setback, and our dedicated fight to value women and babies is far from over,\" said Emily Massey, a spokesperson for the pro-amendment campaign.\nThe electorate in Tuesday's vote wasn't typical for a Kansas primary, particularly because tens of thousands of unaffiliated voters cast ballots.\nKristy Winter, 52, a Kansas City-area teacher and unaffiliated voter, voted against the measure and brought her 16-year-old daughter with her to her polling place.\n\"I want her to have the same right to do what she feels is necessary, mostly in the case of rape or incest,\" she said. \"I want her to have the same rights my mother has had most of her life.\"\nOpponents of the measure predicted that the anti-abortion groups and lawmakers behind the measure would push quickly for an abortion ban if voters approved it. Before the vote, the measure's supporters refused to say whether they would pursue a ban as they appealed to voters who supported both some restrictions and some access to abortion.\nStephanie Kostreva, a 40-year-old school nurse from the Kansas City area and a Democrat, said she voted in favor of the measure because she is a Christian and believes life begins at conception.\n\"I'm not full scale that there should never be an abortion,\" she said. \"I know there are medical emergencies, and when the mother's life is in danger there is no reason for two people to die.\"\nAn anonymous group sent a misleading text Monday to Kansas voters telling them to \"vote yes\" to protect choice, but it was suspended late Monday from the Twilio messaging platform it was using, a spokesperson said. Twilio did not identify the sender.\nThe 2019 Kansas Supreme Court decision protecting abortion rights blocked a law that banned the most common second-trimester procedure, and another law imposing special health regulations on abortion providers also is on hold. Abortion opponents argued that all of the state's existing restrictions were in danger, though some legal scholars found that argument dubious. Kansas doesn't ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy.\nThe Kansas vote is the start of what could be a long-running series of legal battles playing out where lawmakers are more conservative on abortion than governors or state courts. Kentucky will vote in November on whether to add language similar to Kansas' proposed amendment to its state constitution.\nMeanwhile, Vermont will decide in November whether to add an abortion rights provision to its constitution. A similar question is likely headed to the November ballot in Michigan.\nIn Kansas, both sides together spent more than US$14 million on their campaigns. Abortion providers and abortion rights groups were key donors to the \"no\" side, while Catholic dioceses heavily funded the \"yes\" campaign.\nThe state has had strong anti-abortion majorities in its Legislature for 30 years, but voters have regularly elected Democratic governors, including Laura Kelly in 2018. She opposed the proposed amendment, saying changing the state constitution would \"throw the state back into the Dark Ages.\"\nState Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican hoping to unseat Kelly, supported the proposed constitutional amendment. He told the Catholic television network EWTN before the election that \"there's still room for progress\" in decreasing abortions, without spelling out what he would sign as governor.\nAlthough abortion opponents pushed almost annually for new restrictions until the 2019 state Supreme Court ruling, they felt constrained by past court rulings and Democratic governors like Kelly.\n------\nStafford reported from Overland Park and Olathe",

You can\u2019t kidnap a person who has not been born alive,\" said Jeff Harrelson in his final argument to the jury.\nProsecutors said, however, that several medical professionals testified the infant had a heartbeat when born. They also recounted Parker\u2019s actions leading to the day Simmons-Hancock was killed.\n\"We have methodically laid out what she did, why she did it, all the moving parts, and all the collateral damage. The best evidence the state of Texas has that baby was born alive is that Taylor Parker said it wasn\u2019t,\" said prosecutor Kelley Crisp.\nFellow prosecutor Lauren Richards recounted all of the masquerades Parker performed for different people, including the pregnancy she faked leading up to the killing.\n\"In the past two weeks, the evidence has never been more clear,\" Assistant District Attorney Lauren Richards told the jury. \"She\u2019s a liar, a manipulator, and now she\u2019s going to be held accountable for it.\"\nShe reminded the jury of how Reagan was beaten in the head at least five times with such force that the blows compressed her skull into her brain.\n\"The pain Reagan must have felt when Taylor started cutting her abdomen, hip to hip \u2026 indescribable,\" Richards said. \"When Taylor had the baby and Reagan was still alive, that\u2019s when Taylor started slashing and cutting.

The Taliban's deputy leader and interior minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, said the world had demanded inclusive government and education and these issues would take time.\nBut the group's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, who is normally based in the southern city of Kandahar and rarely appears in public, said foreigners should not give orders.\nThe gathering's final statement said defence of the Islamic Emirate was obligatory and that the Islamic State militant group, which has said it was behind several attacks in the country, was illegal.\nIt said it would not interfere with neighbouring countries and they should not interfere in Afghanistan.",

Ahead of the boy's cremation, some ''outsiders'' tried to intervene while the family and administration were holding talks about compensation and tried to snatch the body but police quickly restored order, they said. Indra Meghwal, a class 3 student of Saraswati Vidhay Mandir in Surana village in Jalore district, was beaten up on July 20 allegedly for touching a drinking water pot and succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Ahmedabad on Saturday.\nPolice have arrested the teacher, Chail Singh, 40, and charged him with murder and under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Act.\nThe incident has evoked sharp reactions from various political parties, with the BJP demanding action against the owner of the school and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati demanding President's Rule in Rajasthan. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also condemned the incident and said the accused should be given harshest punishment.\nOfficials said the boy was cremated in his village in the presence of Jalore district magistrate Nishant Jian and Superintendent of Police Harshvardhan Agarwalla. Both the officials also held a meeting with the victim's family members at their home in the village. ''The family has already been provided the cheque of Rs 5 lakh announced by the chief minister. The family is also entitled for another compensation of Rs 8 lakh under SC/ST rules. This amount will also be disbursed to the family next week,'' the SP said. Police said some ''outsiders'' also tried to take control of the negotiations between the family and the administration, forcing the family to agree on a compensation of Rs 50 lakh and a government job to one of the family members.\nThey tried to snatch the body of the victim from the family. During this, they also began pelting stones on the police but were soon controlled and pushed away, police said. Agarwalla, however, said the people involved in this were soon controlled by the police and were pushed away. Adequate deployment of police personnel was done at the boy's village in order to ward off any untoward incident, officials said. The senior police official said the family was satisfied with the compensation package given by the government and also agreed later for the postmortem and cremation of the body.\nMeanwhile, a purported audio clip of a conversation between the victim's father and the teacher has gone viral. The father is heard in the clip complaining about the thrashing of the boy while the teacher is heard giving an assurance to him about providing treatment to him and compensation.\nA purported video clip has also gone viral, in which Devaram, the victim's father, is seen appealing to organisations like Bheem Army to support him. The BJP on Sunday demanded action against the owner of a private school. Party's state president Satish Poonia charged that such incidents happen when the state government and chief minister are weak. ''Incidents of Dalit atrocities have happened one after another in the last three-and-a-half years. This happens when the state government, chief minister are weak. The guilty must be punished at the earliest,'' Poonia told reporters.\n''When the country is celebrating 75th year of independence, such an incident forces us to think where we are standing. A society is made up of unity and harmony, and for us society is paramount,\u201d he said.\nReacting to the incident, BSP chief Mayawati demanded President's Rule in Rajasthan and said no amount of condemnation of this painful incident is less.\nSlamming the Ashok Gehlot government, she said, ''Such painful casteist incidents happen almost everyday in Rajasthan. This incident is a clear example to show that the Congress government has failed in protecting the life and dignity of people, especially the Dalits, tribals and the neglected. Therefore, it would be better if this government is dismissed and President's Rule imposed.'' PTI COR TDS TDS",

The Lost City star apparently thinks that he may be suffering from undiagnosed \u201cface blindness,\" called prosopagnosia, which the NHS describes as a condition in which people are not able to recognise family members, partners or friends.\nBrad Pitt thinks he suffers from 'face blindness' called Prosopagnosia\nIn a conversation with GQ, Brad Pitt opened up about his possible medical condition, known as prosopagnosia, claiming that he struggles to remember people and can come off as \u201cremote and aloof.\u201d The 58-year-old told the publication that the condition enables him to recognize faces, especially at parties and other gatherings, which leads to them thinking he is \u201cremote and aloof, inaccessible, self-absorbed.\u201d\nThe Moneyball actor said that in reality, he wants to remember the people he meets, adding that he is ashamed that he cannot. Though Pitt has never officially been diagnosed with prosopagnosia, he thinks that he may suffer from the condition.\nWhat is Prosopagnosia?\nAs per NHS, Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, means one cannot recognise people's faces. Face blindness affects people from birth and is usually a problem a person has for most or all of their life. Prosopagnosia can have a severe impact on everyday life as several people with the condition are not able to recognise family members, partners or friends. They may cope by using alternative strategies to recognise people, such as remembering the way they walk or their hairstyle, voice or clothing.\nWhat causes Prosopagnosia?\nThere are 2 types of prosopagnosia:\nDevelopmental prosopagnosia: A person has prosopagnosia without having brain damage\nAcquired prosopagnosia: A person develops prosopagnosia after brain damage, often following a stroke or head injury\nIn the past, most cases of prosopagnosia were thought to occur after a brain injury. But research has found that many more people have prosopagnosia without having brain damage than was first thought.\nTreating Prosopagnosia\nSo far, there is no specific treatment for prosopagnosia, but researchers are figuring out what causes the condition, and training programmes are being developed to help improve facial recognition.\nImage: Instagram/@bradpittofficial",

The patients have since returned to normal temperatures, it said.\nNorth Korean officials lifted the lockdown but urged residents to maintain vigilance by continuing to wear masks and reporting to health authorities immediately if they experience fever symptoms.\nWhile Kim claimed that the country\u2019s success against the virus would be recognized as a global health miracle, experts believe North Korea has manipulated disclosures on its outbreak to help him maintain absolute control. The victory statement signals Kim\u2019s aim to move to other priorities, including a possible nuclear test, experts say.\nAfter admitting to a coronavirus outbreak in May, North Korea reported about 4.8 million \u201cfever cases\u201d across its mostly unvaccinated population of 26 million but only identified a fraction of them as COVID-19. Experts say the country\u2019s official death toll of 74 is abnormally small, considering the country\u2019s lack of public health tools.\nNorth Korea dubiously insists that rival South Korea was responsible for its COVID-19 outbreak and has warned of \u201cdeadly\u201d retaliation, saying that the virus was transported by anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets and other materials flown across the border by balloons launched by South Korean civilian activists. South Korea has dismissed such claims as unscientific and \u201cridiculous.\u201d",

Police eventually shot and killed the gunman.\nLocal police have been under intense scrutiny since it emerged that more than a dozen officers waited for over an hour outside a pair of adjoining classrooms where the shooting was taking place and did nothing as children lay dead or dying inside.\nArredondo, who was suspended in June pending an investigation, earlier on Wednesday asked for his suspension to be lifted through a statement from his lawyer, criticising his treatment since the shooting.\n\"Chief Arredondo will not participate in his own illegal and unconstitutional public lynching and respectfully requests the Board immediately reinstate him, with all backpay and benefits and close the complaint as unfounded,\" lawyer George Hyde said in a statement released shortly before the school board's vote.\nTexas state lawmakers also slammed Arredondo in a report last month, saying he \"did not assume his preassigned responsibility of incident command\" and made analytical errors because he did not have all the necessary information.\nThe lawmakers said the situation was \"chaotic\" due to the 376 on-scene officers' \"lackadaisical approach\" to subduing the gunman.\nThey said no other officers offered to help or replace Arredondo during the massacre.\nSeventy-three minutes elapsed between the first officers' arrival and the shooter's death, an \"unacceptably long period of time\".\n\"The void of leadership could have contributed to the loss of life,\" the report said.\n\"It is plausible that some victims could have survived if they had not had to wait 73 additional minutes for rescue,\" according to the report.",

The maximum sentence was ten years.

The side won the silver medal at the Commonwealth Games 2022 and followed it up with a historic ODI series win over England and a record Asia Cup triumph.\nWhile the latest announcement was a huge initiative towards addressing the pay disparity between the players of the two teams, it is only the first step. When it comes to revenue sharing and central contracts, the gap remains massive \u2013 both in terms of money and exposure.\nEvery year, BCCI pays 26 per cent of its annual revenue to the players.\n13 per cent of the revenue is given to men\u2019s international team players, 10.3 per cent to domestic cricketers and just 2.7 per cent is earmarked for junior players and women cricketers.\nAlso read | T20 World Cup: R Ashwin recalls last over drama in Indo-Pak contest - WATCH\nThe same is applicable while talking about central contracts.\nThe men\u2019s team cricketers are divided into four categories \u2013 Grade A+, Grade B, Grade C and Grade D.\nIn a stark contrast, the highest paid women cricketers get a yearly contract worth a bit more than $60,000. To put in simpler terms, one of the highest paid women cricketers in India right now \u2013 opener Smriti Mandhana \u2013 holds the same contract that Sachin Tendulkar would have had in 2004.\nHowever, things have taken a turn lately.

Juan Maldonado with termination papers, spokeswoman Ericka Miller said.\nThe firing comes five months after the shooting at Robb Elementary School that has put state police under scrutiny over their actions on the campus as a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers.\nBody camera footage and media reports have shown the Department of Public Safety had a larger role at the scene than the department appeared to suggest after the May 24 shooting. State troopers were among the first wave of officers to arrive but did not immediately confront the gunman, which experts say goes against standard police procedure during mass shootings.\nInstead, more than 70 minutes passed before officers finally stormed inside a fourth-grade classroom and killed the gunman, ending one of the deadliest school attacks in U.S. history. Nearly 400 officers in all eventually made their way to the scene, including state police, Uvalde police, school officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents.\nMaldonado could not be reached for comment Friday night.\nSeven Department of Public Safety troopers were put under internal investigation this summer after a damning report by lawmakers revealed that state police has more 90 officers at the scene, more than any other agency.\nSteve McCraw, the Department of Public Safety director, has called the law enforcement response an \"abject failure\" but put most of the blame on former Uvalde school police Chief Pete Arredondo, who was fired in August and can be seen on body cam video searching in futility for a key to the classroom door that may been unlocked the entire time.\nBut the Uvalde mayor, parents of the victims and some lawmakers have accused the Department of Public Safety of trying to minimize its own failures.\nState Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat whose district includes Uvalde, reacted to news of the firing by saying that accountability in the department should not end there.\n\"Ninety more to go, plus the DPS director,\" he said.\nGutierrez has sued the department in an effort to obtain documents surrounding the response to the shooting. Several media outlets, including The Associated Press, have also asked courts to compel authorities and Uvalde officials to release records under public information laws.\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is up for reelection in November, has stood by McCraw and said during a September debate there needed to be \"accountability for law enforcement at every level.\" A spokesperson for Abbott did not return messages seeking comment about the firing.\nOne of the state troopers put under internal investigation was Crimson Elizondo, who resigned and later was hired by Uvalde schools to work as a campus police officer. She was fired less than 24 hours after outraged parents in Uvalde found out about her hiring.\n___\nMore on the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas:\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/uvalde-school-shooting",

Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said Monday\u2019s agreement reflects a commitment to look out for consumers.\n\u201cWhen it comes to location, we consider that to be absolutely one of the most important areas to protect them,\u201d she said. Location data is especially sensitive, according to Rosenblum, because it can impact people\u2019s safety.\n\u201cWe want to protect them, both physically and financially, when it comes to how they use technology,\u201d she said.\nGoogle didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Thirty-nine other states joined the agreement, with talks led by Oregon and Nebraska. Three other states and the District of Columbia are pursuing a separate lawsuit over Google\u2019s location tracking.\nOregon collects $14.8 million as part of the agreement, money that will go into a state consumer protection fund.\nAnd Google has agreed to make its location tracking policies more transparent and to email people with Google accounts to ensure they understand they have the option to opt out of certain location tracking settings.\n\u201cGoogle is able to still do some location tracking. The settlement limits some of the ways they can use location information,\u201d said Kristen Hilton, deputy attorney general for consumer privacy.\nThe Oregon Department of Justice is preparing a bill for the upcoming session that would require companies to obtain specific, \u201copt-in\u201d permission from users before tracking their specific location.\n\u201cThe current state of the laws that we\u2019re operating under do have limitations that we hope will be addressed by comprehensive privacy legislation,\u201d Hilton said.\nThe Associated Press article that triggered the investigation found that Google had incorrectly promised consumers that turning off their location history prevents the company from storing their whereabouts. The issue affects everyone who uses a Google Android phone as well as those using Google Maps on iPhones or other devices.\nOregon\u2019s Department of Justice took a leading role in the case because the state has several years of experience in pursuing online consumer protections, according to Rosenblum.\n\u201cIn the last few years it\u2019s been clear that privacy and security, data security, are key,\u201d she said.\n-- Mike Rogoway | mrogoway@oregonian.com | Twitter: @rogoway |\nOur journalism needs your support.

As we work together to preserve the principles and practices of religious freedom together with the rights of LGBTQ individuals much can be accomplished to heal relationships and foster greater understanding,\" an unnamed spokesperson for the church said.\nSupport for the Respect for Marriage Act under consideration in Congress is the church's latest step to stake out a more welcoming stance toward the LGBTQ community while holding firm to its belief that same-sex relationships are sinful.\nPatrick Mason, a professor of religious studies at Utah State University, said the church's position was both a departure from and continuation of its past stances -- respecting laws yet working to safeguard religious liberty and ensuring they won't be forced to perform same-sex marriages or grant them official church sanction.\n\"This is part of the church's overall theology essentially sustaining the law of the land, recognizing that what they dictate and enforce for their members in terms of their behaviour is different than what it means to be part of a pluralistic society,\" he said.\nThe faith opposes same-sex marriage and sexual intimacy, but it has taken a more welcoming stance to LGBTQ people in recent years. In 2016, it declared that same-sex attraction is not a sin, while maintaining that acting on it was.\n------\nNews Editor Brady McCombs contributed to this report.",

He is due back in court next month.\nOn Wednesday, Attorney General Garland placed a flower bouquet at a memorial for the Buffalo victims outside the supermarket, which has been closed since the shooting, the Associated Press news agency reported.\nGarland had ordered a moratorium on federal executions last year, so it is not clear whether the Justice Department will pursue the death sentence against Gendron.\nThe attack in Buffalo was followed by another mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas where a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at a primary school.\nThe shootings renewed calls for gun control reforms across the country.

Only Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton are ahead of him on that list. He also holds the league record for most games played as a running back.\nGore, a third-round selection by the 49ers in 2005, is tops in the franchise annals in rushing attempts and yards and ranks second in rushing touchdowns.\n\"Frank had to overcome many challenges upon entering the NFL and now leaves the game not only as one of the best backs in NFL history, but one of the best football players ever,\" 49ers CEO Jed York said in a statement. \"Frank\u2019s 16-year NFL career is a testament to his durability, having played in more games than any other running back in league history.\"\nThe 39-year-old last played in the NFL in 2020, appearing in 15 games for the New York Jets and tallying 653 yards.\nGore's athletic career has turned to boxing, where he fought former NBA player Deron Williams in a celebrity exhibition in December and notched his first knockout in his professional debut in May.\nBut he'll always have a special place in his heart for the 49ers Faithful.\n\"This organization will always be a part of me, one that I will forever associate myself with,\" he said. \"I will talk about San Francisco as \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018us\u2019 for the rest of my life, and will support the 49ers and The Faithful in every way possible.\"\nDownload and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast",

The influential think tank said it no longer accepts Qatari money.\nOlson and Zuberi were working together on a separate matter in Qatar when Saudi Arabia and other neighboring nations announced a blockade against Qatar in mid-2017 accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations.\nAfter the blockade was announced, then-president Donald Trump appeared to support Qatar in the diplomatic crisis.\nU.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Olson AP/Susan Walsh\nAccording to court documents, Allen lobbied then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster to have the Trump administration adopt a more Qatar-friendly tone.\nIn a June 9 email to McMaster, Allen wrote the Qataris were \u201casking for some help\u201d and were requesting the White House or State Department to issue a statement calling on all sides involved to \u201cact with restraint.\u201d\nTwo days later, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson issued a statement asking Gulf countries to \u201cease the blockade against Qatar\u201d and asked \u201cthat there be no further escalation by the parties in the region.\u201d\nFederal authorities claim Allen persuaded Tillerson to issue the statement that had \u201cshifted away from earlier statements by the White House.\u201d\nThe blockade ended four years later in January 2021 after a deal was brokered with the help of Jared Kushner and other government officials.\nWith Post Wires",

But output has dwindled in recent years to about 93,000 barrels per day, from about 160,000 bpd in 2015 due to maturing fields.\nAlthough the tiny Gulf of Guinea nation has seen major investments in infrastructure, critics say under Obiang, oil wealth has lined the pockets of his entourage, who flash luxury lifestyles while most of the population live in poverty.\nObiang is also accused of muzzling dissent and freedom of expression. The government has denied the accusations.\nProtests are mostly forbidden, media is heavily controlled, and it is not uncommon for political opponents to be arbitrarily arrested and tortured, rights groups say.\nIntimidation has increased in the run-up to the polls, activists say, with authorities targeting civil society groups and critics of the regime.\nIn September, security forces raided the headquarters of a banned opposition party \u2013 the only one with a seat in parliament \u2013 and detained at least 100 of its members.\n\u201cOn Sunday, people will cast the vote the government expects them to, because you cannot freely speak up your mind in Equatorial Guinea,\u201d human rights activist Tutu Alicante told Reuters.\n\u201cWhatever It Takes\u201d\nRepression before the vote has offset efforts by Obiang to improve his image abroad, the latest seen in a move to abolish the death penalty earlier this year.\n\u201cHe is washing his face in front of the international community,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s Senior Campaigner for West Africa Marta Colomer.\nAlleged corruption has also tainted Obiang\u2019s tenure despite several pledges to increase transparency.\nHis son, Vice President Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, who observers see as a potential successor, was convicted for embezzlement by a French court in 2020.\nAssets that foreign powers say he bought with ill-gotten gains include a crystal-covered glove worn by Michael Jackson, an armoured Rolls-Royce limousine and a yacht.\nBoth father and son have consistently denied wrongdoing.\nIf re-elected, Obiang will face new challenges. The economy was hit by COVID-19 and although the war in Ukraine has boosted demand for non-Russian oil it has also brought a sharp rise in food prices.\n\u201cThe opposition does not stand a chance,\u201d Alicante said. \u201cHe is going to do whatever it takes not to leave power.\u201d",

But it generally treats as credible rights groups\u2019 and activists claims that China has detained Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others, often for having overseas ties or for expressing religious faith. The report said, however, that the U.N. agency \u201cis not in a position to confirm estimates of total numbers of individuals affected by the VETC system,\u201d referring to the so-called Vocational Education and Training Center.\nWhen news of the detentions began trickling out, Chinese authorities at first denied the detention campaign but later said they were teaching basic job and language skills to bolster employment and prevent radicalism.\nFormer detainees, however, have described physical abuse, mistreatment and hours of indoctrination in Communist Party ideology. Some of those held have included successful artists, scholars, businesspeople and other community leaders who had no need for job training.\nThe report said allegations of sexual and gender-based violence, including of rape, \u201cappear credible and would in themselves amount to acts of torture or other forms of ill-treatment.\u201d",

The new film due out on Netflix in June 2023, recasts Hemsworth as the lethal mercenary Tyler Rake, and the actor claims the stunts are greater than ever, calling \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been part of anything as intense or extreme as the battle training I was involved in.\u201d\nHemsworth recently spoke to Entertainment Weekly on the upcoming film\u2019s enormous action scenes, praising the work that he and director Sam Hargrave who formerly worked as a stunt supervisor came up with.\nThe stunts, according to Hemsworth, were immensely fulfilling \u2013 even more so than his previous work on Marvel films, due to how authentic they were.\n\u201cWe kind of shot for the moon,\u201d Hemsworth, 39, laughs to EW. It\u2019s even more extraordinary to accomplish something so extraordinary in the midst of an action-packed world.\nExtraction 2 begins up immediately after the events of the previous film, with Rake having survived the horrific fall off a bridge. Now he faces an even more dangerous mission: breaking into an impenetrable prison to save the family of a vicious Georgian criminal. \u201cIt\u2019s an escape mission,\u201d teases Hargrave. \u201creally nothing Rake has ever witnessed is as large, absolutely horrific, extreme, or terrifying like what he is going to face.\u201d\nBoth Hargrave and Hemsworth wanted the sequel to delve more into Rake\u2019s biography, questioning his moral compass and delving into his tangled past. They also wanted to mix it with a high-stakes show, so they added even more stunts.\nHemsworth said he especially enjoyed working with the various departments and performing as many actual stunts as possible.\nOne particularly difficult scenario takes place in a wintry prison yard and involves over 300 extras. It\u2019s just extremely satisfying,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have a great deal of assistance in post-production in Marvel movies, which can be special effects-heavy.\nObviously, I can\u2019t fly, so they assist me in that regard. In this film, the action is grounded in fact, and most of it is captured on camera. So it\u2019s a different atmosphere, and the preparation is much more thorough.\u201d\nThe first Extraction was a huge smash for Netflix, apparently becoming the most-watched original film in the streaming service\u2019s history.\nFor the sequel, the same filmmaking crew returns, with Sam Hargrave directing and Hemsworth\u2019s Avengers directors Joe and Anthony Russo producing. The screenplay was also written by Joe Russo.",

The decision by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon came despite the objections of the Justice Department, which said an outside legal expert was not necessary in part because officials had already completed their review of potentially privileged documents.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a legal victory for former President Donald Trump, a federal judge on Monday granted his request for a special master to review documents seized by the FBI from his Florida home and temporarily halted the Justice Department\u2019s use of the records for investigative purposes.\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon authorizes an outside legal expert to review the records taken during the Aug. 8 search and to weed out from the rest of the investigation any that might be protected by claims of attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. Some of those records may ultimately be returned to Trump, but the judge put off a ruling on that question.\nAd\nThe order came despite the strenuous objections of the Justice Department, which said a special master was not necessary in part because officials had already completed their review of potentially privileged documents. The department said Monday that it was reviewing the decision but did not indicate if and when it might appeal.\nThe order almost certainly slows the pace of the department\u2019s investigation into the presence of top-secret information at Mar-a-Lago, particularly given the judge\u2019s directive that the Justice Department may not for the moment use any of the seized materials as part of its investigation into the storage of government secrets at the Florida property. The injunction is in place until the yet-to-be-named special master completes his or her work, or until \u201cfurther court order.\u201d\nAd\n\u201cThe Court is mindful that restraints on criminal prosecutions are disfavored, but finds that these unprecedented circumstances call for a brief pause to allow for neutral, third-party review to ensure a just process with adequate safeguards,\u201d Cannon, a Trump appointee, wrote in her 24-page order.\nEven so, it is not clear that the decision will present a long-term impediment to the investigation's progress or significantly affect investigative decisions or the ultimate outcome of the probe. And a separate assessment by the U.S. intelligence community of the risk posed by the apparent mishandling of classified records will continue under the judge's order.\n\u201cWhile this is a victory for the former President, it is by no means an overwhelming win for him,\u201d David Weinstein, a Florida criminal defense lawyer and former Justice Department prosecutor, said in an email. \u201cWhile it is a setback for the government, it is also not a devastating loss for them.\u201d\nAd\nHe noted, for instance, that the judge did not immediately order the seized documents returned to Trump or suppress any of the evidence.\nJustice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said Monday that \u201cthe United States is examining the opinion and will consider appropriate next steps in the ongoing litigation.\u201d A lawyer for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe department and Trump's lawyers are to submit by Friday a list of proposed special master candidates.\nFBI agents in August seized roughly 11,000 documents and 1,800 other items from Mar-a-Lago as part of a criminal investigation into the retention of national defense information there, as well as into efforts to obstruct the probe. About 100 of the documents contained classification markings.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had argued that a special master, usually an outside lawyer or former judge, was necessary to ensure an independent review of records taken during the search and so that any personal information or documents could be filtered out and returned to Trump.\nAd\nIn this case, the seized records \u201cinclude medical documents, correspondence related to taxes, and accounting information,\u201d the judge's order said.\nCannon said it was too soon to know whether Trump will be entitled to the return of any of the records, but \u201cfor now, the circumstances surrounding the seizure in this case and the associated need for adequate procedural safeguards are sufficiently compelling to at least get Plaintiff past the courthouse doors.\u201d\nShe also said she found persuasive his lawyers' arguments that he faced potentially \u201cirreparable injury\u201d by being denied access to records that might be of significant personal interest to him. She said the investigative process had, so far, been \u201cclosed off\u201d to him.\n\u201cAs a function of Plaintiff\u2019s former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cA future indictment, based to any degree on property that ought to be returned, would result in reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.\u201d\nAd\nThe Justice Department had argued against the appointment, saying it was unnecessary because it had already reviewed potentially privileged documents and identified a limited subset that could be covered by attorney-client privilege.\nThe department had been using a separate \u201cprivilege review team\u201d for that work, but Cannon cited at least two instances in which members of the investigative team were \u201cexposed\u201d to potentially privileged material, something she said raised questions about the adequacy of the process.\nThe department had also said Trump was not entitled to the return of any of the presidential records that were taken since he is no longer president and the documents therefore do not belong to him. And personal items that were recovered were commingled with classified information, giving them potential evidentiary value, the department said.\nThough prosecutors had argued that Trump, as a former president, had no legal basis to assert executive privilege over the documents, the judge said he was entitled to raise it as a concern and permitted the special master to look for records that might be covered by that privilege.\nAd\n\u201cThe major sticking point, I think, is that the executive privilege documents were included\u201d in the judge\u2019s decision, said Florida criminal defense lawyer Richard Serafini, a former Justice Department prosecutor.\nCannon, who was nominated by Trump in 2020, had signaled last month that she was inclined to appoint a special master and did so again during arguments last week, asking at one point, \u201cUltimately, what is the harm in the appointment of a special master to sort through these issues without creating undue delay?\u201d\n____\nFollow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",

        "article": "New York's attorney general Letitia James has filed a lawsuit in state court in New York against Donald Trump and his company, in the culmination of the Democrat\u2019s three-year civil investigation into the former US president's business.\nJames announced the lawsuit at a much-awaited press conference on Wednesday, during which she accused Trump of being involved in business fraud linked to some of his most prized assets, including properties in Manhattan, Chicago and Washington, DC. Specifically, she said Trump has systematically misstated the value of his properties, intentionally lying to lenders and insurers for more than a decade.\nIn the 220-page lawsuit, the attorney general brought plenty of examples of the alleged fraud committed by the former president and his family business.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a press conference, Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2022, in New York. Brittainy Newman/AP\nThe goal of the lawsuit, James explained, is to strike at the core of that same sense of opulence and entrepreneurship that the former US president has built his image and reputation on.\n\u201cDonald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself, and cheat the system, thereby cheating all of us,\u201d James said at the news conference.\nMore practically, the lawsuit is trying to get Trump and his three eldest children from ever running a business in the state of New York again. Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump, the former US president's eldest children, are in fact also defendants in the lawsuit, as well as two long-time company executives, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney.\nIf successful, the lawsuit will remove the Trumps from businesses engaged in the alleged fraud and introduce an independent monitor appointed for no less than five years to oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s compliance, financial reporting, valuations and disclosures to lenders, insurers and tax authorities.\nThe current trustees of Trump\u2019s revocable trust, which controls his business interests, would also be replaced with independent trustees, Trump and his organization would be barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years and from obtaining loans from banks in New York for five years, and the former president and his three eldest children would be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director in any New York corporation or similar business entity registered and/or licensed in New York State.\nDonald Trump, right, sits with his children, from left, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump in 2014. Evan Vucci/AP\nWeisselberg and McConney, on the other hand, would be permanently barred from serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity registered and/or licensed in New York State.\nThe lawsuit could also be potentially escalated to the federal level.\nIn her speech on Wednesday, James concluded that Trump and his family business violated several state criminal laws and \u201cplausibly\u201d broke federal criminal laws as well. But her office lacks authority to file criminal charges in this case and has referred the findings to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\nIt's unclear whether the US attorney would investigate.",

The company said in an email Thursday that lawsuit will determine whether \u201cthere is coverage in this matter.\u201d\nAccording to court documents, the woman, identified as M.O., and a man, who were in a relationship, had sex in the man\u2019s car. She contends she contracted HPV, human papillomavirus, because the man did not tell her he had the disease. HPV can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts.\nIn February 2021, M.O. notified Geico she planned to seek a $1 million insurance settlement against the man. She argued the man\u2019s auto insurance provided coverage for her injuries and losses.\nThe insurance company refused the settlement offer, saying the woman\u2019s claim did not occur because of normal use of the vehicle, according to court documents.\nAn arbitrator eventually determined she should be awarded $5.2 million for damages and her injuries. She then filed a motion in Jackson County Court seeking to confirm the award.\nGeico claimed it did not know the man and woman had entered into arbitration and, when it found out, it sought to intervene in the court case. The company argued the arbitration award was reached through collusion and fraud, violated its rights to due process and was unenforceable.\nThe lower court rejected Geico\u2019s requests and confirmed the award, prompting the insurance company\u2019s appeal because it said it did not have a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to defend its interests, according to court documents.\nThe appeals court found that Geico did not have the right to \u201cre-litigate\u201d the issues after the award had been affirmed.\nBy MARGARET STAFFORD\nAssociated Press",

Heard filed counterclaims, alleging that Depp's former lawyer defamed her by publicly characterizing her abuse allegations as a hoax.\nThe jury ordered Heard to pay Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. The punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 under a state cap. The jury awarded Heard $2 million on her counterclaim.\nMuch of the testimony during the six-week trial focused on Heard's claims that she had been physically and sexually abused by Depp at least a dozen times.

The boy\u2019s symptoms began about a week after visiting Lake Mead, and following an investigation conducted by the health district and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Naegleria fowleri was confirmed as the boy's cause of death, according to the officials.\nAccording to the National Park Service, the amoeba occurs naturally in freshwater \u2014 especially in warm bodies with low elevation \u2014 and has been found before in Lake Mead.\n\"My condolences go out to the family of this young man,\" said Dr. Fermin Leguen, the district health officer for Southern Nevada, in a statement. \"While I want to reassure the public that this type of infection is an extremely rare occurrence, I know this brings no comfort to his family and friends at this time.\"\nThe CDC recorded 154 confirmed cases of infection by Naegleria fowleri in the U.S. between 1962 and 2021, and at least 31 of them were recorded over the last 10 years, with nearly all of those cases being fatal.\nWhile this boy's death is the first in the state, it comes after at least two other cases of the infection reported in 2022, including one person hospitalized after swimming in a lake in Iowa, and a child who died after swimming in a Nebraska river.\n\u201cThe National Park Service, working with the NPS Office of Public Health, has made the decision to continue to allow recreational swimming at Lake Mead National Recreation Area as the organism exists naturally and commonly in the environment but disease is extremely rare,\u201d Dr. Maria Said, U.S Public Health Service Officer, said to National Parks Traveler.\n\u201cHowever, recreational water users should always assume there is a risk anytime they enter warm fresh water,\u201d Said said.\nTo lower the risk of exposure, the CDC recommends that people:\nAvoid jumping or diving into bodies of warm, fresh water.\nHold their noses shut, use nose clips, or keep their heads above water while swimming in those areas.\nAvoid submerging their heads in hot springs and other bodies of water that are untreated.\nRefrain from digging up sediment in freshwater that is shallow and warm.\nRelated Stories",

She acknowledged in court earlier this month that she had vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage when she arrived in Russia but contends she had no criminal intent and packed the cartridges inadvertently.\nDuring her testimony, the Phoenix Mercury standout described making a grueling 13-hour flight to Moscow from Arizona while recovering from COVID-19. Griner said she still does not know how the cannabis oil ended up in her bag but explained she had a doctor\u2019s recommendation for it and had packed in haste.\nShe recalled getting pulled aside at the airport on Feb. 17 after inspectors found the cartridges.\nAlong with the interpreter who provided an incomplete translation, Griner said she received neither an explanation of her rights nor access to a lawyer and was instructed to sign documents without an explanation of what they implied.\nAfter hours of proceedings she did not understand, she was allowed to hand over her personal belongings to a lawyer before being led away in handcuffs, Griner said. She said she received only a cursory translation of the allegations during a Feb. 19 hearing where a court sanctioned her arrest.\nGriner faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of transporting drugs. Her trial started July 1, and Wednesday was her first appearance as a witness. The court outside Moscow held five previous sessions that were short, some lasting only about an hour.\nMORE: Brittney Griner: WNBA star's Russian trial considers medicinal use of cannabis\nIt is unclear how long the trial will last, but a court has authorized Griner\u2019s detention until Dec. 20. She went to Russia to play for a Russian team in the WNBA\u2019s off-season.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s court session of about 90 minutes, a Russian neuropsychologist testified about worldwide use of medicinal cannabis, which remains illegal in Russia. Griner\u2019s defense team has submitted a U.S. doctor\u2019s letter recommending the basketball player use medical cannabis to treat pain.\nGriner testified Wednesday that she was suffering from pain from injuries sustained during her basketball career. She emphasized that cannabis oil is widely used in the United States for medicinal purposes and has less negative effects than some other painkillers\nA Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said last week that the legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational use in parts of the U.S. had no bearing on what happens in Russia.\nThe slow-moving trial and Griner\u2019s five months of detention have raised strong criticism among teammates and supporters in the United States, which has formally declared her to be \"wrongfully detained,\" a designation sharply rejected by Russian officials.\nMORE: Arizona Sens.

But it pointed squarely at controlling inflation as the bigger priority.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cThe hard-won credibility of central banks could be undermined if they misjudge yet again the stubborn persistence of inflation,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cThis would prove much more detrimental to future macroeconomic stability.\u201d\nThe Fund forecast headline consumer price inflation peaking at 9.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2022, declining to 4.7 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2023.\nA \u201cplausible combination of shocks\u201d including a 30 per cent spike in oil prices from current levels could darken the outlook considerably, the IMF said, pushing global growth down to 1.0 per cent next year \u2013 a level associated with widely falling real incomes.\nOther components of this \u201cdownside scenario\u201d include a steep drop-off in Chinese property sector investment, a sharp tightening of financial conditions brought on by emerging market currency depreciations and labor markets remaining overheated resulting in lower potential output.\nThe IMF put a 25 per cent probability of global growth falling below two per cent next year \u2013 a phenomenon that has occurred only five times since 1970 \u2013 and said there was a more than 10 per cent chance of a global GDP contraction.\n1:49 Poiliviere criticizes Liberals for \u2018tripling, tripling, tripling\u2019 carbon tax as families struggle financially Poiliviere criticizes Liberals for \u2018tripling, tripling, tripling\u2019 carbon tax as families struggle financially\nThese shocks could keep inflation elevated for longer, which in turn could keep upward pressure on the U.S. dollar, now at its strongest since the early 2000s.

On 1 March, Meyer, who helped Stanford win the 2019 NCAA College Cup championship game, received a six-page formal charge email from Stanford\u2019s office of community standards, according to the lawsuit, containing a disciplinary notice following an August 2021 incident in which she allegedly spilled coffee on another Stanford student athlete, who was accused of sexually assaulting one of her minor teammates.\nLater that evening, she was found dead in one of Stanford\u2019s residence halls, where she was a residential adviser. According to Meyer\u2019s mother, the previous night she had been in good spirits, video-chatting with her family about a planned spring break with them.\nMeyer\u2019s parents alleged in the lawsuit that the letter Meyer received before she died \u201ccontained threatening language regarding sanctions and potential \u2018removal from the university\u2019\u201d.\n\u201cThe formal disciplinary charge letter related to spilled coffee also informed Katie her diploma was being placed on hold only three months shy of her graduation; threatening her status as a Stanford student, Captain and member of the Soccer team, Residential Advisor, Mayfield Fellow, Defense Innovative Scholar, and her ability to attend Stanford Law school, amongst many other things,\u201d the lawsuit said.\nIt said Meyer contacted to the university immediately after receiving the email, informing them that she was \u201cshocked and distraught\u201d over the notice, but that \u201cStanford employees failed to support Katie when she expressed feelings of despair\u201d.\nAn autopsy confirmed the cause of death was suicide.\nStory continues\n\u201cStanford\u2019s after-hours disciplinary charge, and the reckless nature and manner of submission to Katie, caused Katie to suffer an acute stress reaction that impulsively led to her suicide,\u2019\u2019 the lawsuit said. \u201cKatie\u2019s suicide was completed without planning and solely in response to the shocking and deeply distressing information she received from Stanford while alone in her room without any support or resources.\u2019\u2019\nA Stanford spokesperson, Dee Mostofi, disputed the claims of the lawsuit.\n\u201cThe Stanford community continues to grieve Katie\u2019s tragic death and we sympathize with her family for the unimaginable pain that Katie\u2019s passing has caused them,\u201d ESPN reported Mostofi saying.\n\u201cHowever, we strongly disagree with any assertion that the university is responsible for her death. While we have not yet seen the formal complaint brought by the Meyer family, we are aware of some of the allegations made in the filing, which are false and misleading.\u201d\nMostofi also said that the disciplinary letter which the university sent to Meyer included \u201ca number to call for immediate support and [she] was specifically told that this resource was available to her 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d\n\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

The Chrisleys were initially indicted in August 2019 and a new indictment was filed in February of this year. Their trial began three weeks ago, and a jury on Tuesday found them guilty of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans, according to the office of US Attorney Ryan Buchanan in Atlanta. They were also found guilty of conspiring to defraud the IRS and tax evasion, and Julie Chrisley was convicted of wire fraud and obstruction of justice, the AP reports.\nBruce Morris, an attorney for Todd Chrisley, said he was disappointed with the verdict and expects to appeal. Prosecutors alleged that the Chrisleys submitted fake documents to banks when applying for loans. They said Julie Chrisley also submitted a false credit report and fake bank statements when trying to rent a house in California. They used a company they controlled to hide income to keep the IRS from collecting unpaid taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, prosecutors said. After they were found guilty, US District Judge Eleanor Ross allowed the Chrisleys to remain free on bond. But she placed them on location monitoring and home detention, meaning they can only leave the house for certain reasons, including work, medical appointments, and court appearances.\nPeter Tarantino, an accountant hired by the couple, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the United States and willfully filing false tax returns, the US attorney's office in Atlanta said. Sentencing for all three is set for Oct. 6. Chrisley Knows Best follows the tight-knit, boisterous Chrisley family. The series was just renewed by USA for a 10th season. The trial began in mid-May, days after E! announced that it was moving forward with a new dating series, Love Limo, hosted by Todd Chrisley. \"As today\u2019s outcome shows, when you lie, cheat and steal, justice is blind as to your fame, your fortune, and your position,\u201d Special Agent Keri Farley, head of the FBI Atlanta, said in a statement.",

Russia has denied the gas supply cuts were premeditated.\nGazprom said it was cutting flows via Nord Stream 1 last week, in what could be developing into a diplomatic headache centering around a turbine sent to Canada for repairs.\nA giant Siemens Energy gas turbine used in Nord Stream manufactured in Canada was sent back there for maintenance. Canadian officials have expressed concern about running afoul of sanctions on Moscow, which make it impossible for Siemens to receive the pipeline part.\nThe G7 is likely to discuss the fate of the turbine at their meeting beginning Sunday, Canada\u2019s Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters, citing Germany\u2019s concerns about gas supply.\n\u201dI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll come up at least in the corridors of the G7,\u201d he said. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t hold my breath that we\u2019re going to find a resolution before the end.\u201d\nRead all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",

That left only the lawyers of DIS to continue arguing their case.\nDIS had initially sought a five-year prison sentence for the 30-year-old Neymar. But following the withdrawal of the state prosecutors, DIS\u00b4 lawyers reduced their demands to two-and-a-half years of prison.\nThe legal victory for Neymar comes days after he and his Brazil team were eliminated from the World Cup by Croatia on penalties in the quarterfinals.\nBrazil's Neymar leaves the pitch at the end of World Cup quarterfinal soccer match against Croatia, at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar, Friday, Dec. 9, 2022.\nThe other defendants declared innocent were Neymar\u00b4s father, who goes by the same name, his mother, former Santos president Odilio Rodrigues and former Barcelona executives Sandro Rosell and Josep Bartomeu.\nDIS, which owns a chain of supermarkets in Brazil, said it acquired rights in 2009 to receive 40% of a future Neymar transfer when it paid the player's family 5 million Brazilian reals. DIS claimed it only received its due percentage from the 17 million euros that Barcelona and Santos initially announced as the transfer fee between the clubs, while the real cost was about 82 million euros.\nNeymar joined Barcelona from Brazilian club Santos at the age of 21 amid massive fanfare, when he was already hailed as one of the world's top players. He helped the Spanish giant win a Champions League title and other trophies before he forced a move to current club Paris Saint-Germain in 2017.\n___\nAP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "article": "Israel coalition agrees to dissolve, hold new elections\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s weakened coalition government on Monday decided to dissolve parliament and call new elections.\nThe vote, expected later this year, could bring about the return of a nationalist religious government led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or another prolonged period of political gridlock.\nIn a nationally televised news conference, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said it wasn't easy to disband the government, but he called it \u201cthe right decision for Israel.\u201d\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office announced Monday that his weakened coalition will be disbanded and the country will head to new elections.\nThe election, expected in October or November, would be Israel\u2019s fifth in three years. The election could also set the stage for a return to power by longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now the opposition leader.\nBennett has struggled to keep his unruly coalition of eight parties together since it took office one year ago, and defections have left the crumbling alliance without a majority in parliament for over two months.\nBennett and his main coalition partner, Yair Lapid, decided to present a vote to dissolve parliament in the coming days, Bennett's office said. Lapid is then to serve as caretaker prime minister.\nBennett formed the eight-party coalition in June 2021 after four successive inconclusive elections. It included a diverse array of parties, from dovish factions that support an end to Israel's occupation of lands captured in 1967, to hardline parties that oppose Palestinian independence. It made history by becoming the first Israeli coalition government to include an Arab party.\nThe alliance made a series of accomplishments, including passing the first national budget in several years and navigating a pair of coronavirus outbreaks without imposing any lockdowns.\nBut eventually it unraveled, in large part because several members of Bennett's hard-line party objected to what they felt were compromises made by him to keep the coalition afloat and his perceived moderation.\nThe dissolution threatened to overshadow a visit scheduled next month by President Joe Biden. Israeli media quoted Biden's ambassador, Tom Nides, as saying the visit would take place as planned.\nNetanyahu said the imminent dissolution of parliament was \u201cgreat tidings\u201d for millions of Israelis, and said he would form \u201ca broad nationalist government headed by Likud\u201d after the upcoming elections.\nIsrael held four inconclusive elections between 2019 and 2021 that were largely referendums about Netanyahu\u2019s ability to rule while on trial for corruption. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.\nOpinion polls have forecast that Netanyahu\u2019s hardline Likud will once again emerge as the largest single party. But it remains unclear whether he would be able to muster the required support of a majority of lawmakers to form a new government.",

        "article": "Mozilla has added an official translation tool to Firefox that doesn't rely on cloud processing to do its work, instead performing the machine learning\u2013based process right on your own computer. It's a huge step forward for a popular service tied strongly to giants like Google and Microsoft.\nThe translation tool, called Firefox Translations, can be added to your browser here. It will need to download some resources the first time it translates a language, and presumably it may download improved models if needed, but the actual translation work is done by your computer, not in a data center a couple hundred miles away.\nThis is important not because many people need to translate in their browsers while offline \u2014 like a screen door for a submarine, it's not really a use case that makes sense \u2014 but because the goal is to reduce end reliance on cloud providers with ulterior motives for a task that no longer requires their resources.\nIt's the result of the E.U.-funded Project Bergamot, which saw Mozilla collaborating with several universities on a set of machine learning tools that would make offline translation possible. Normally this kind of work is done by GPU clusters in data centers, where large language models would be deployed to translate a user's query.\nBut while the cloud-based tools of Google and Microsoft are accurate and quick, there's a fundamental privacy and security risk to sending your data to a third party to be analyzed and sent back. For some this risk is acceptable, while others would prefer not to involve internet ad giants if they don't have to.\nIf I Google Translate the menu at the tapas place, will I start being targeted for sausage promotions? More importantly, if someone is translating immigration or medical papers with known device ID and location, will ICE come knocking? Doing it all offline makes sense for anyone at all worried about the privacy implications of using a cloud provider for translation, whatever the situation.\nStory continues\nI quickly tested out the translation quality and found it more than adequate. Here's a piece of the front page of the Spanish language news outlet El Pa\u00eds:\nImage Credits: El Pa\u00eds\nPretty good! Of course, it translated El Pa\u00eds as \"The Paris\" in the tab title, and there were plenty of other questionable phrasings. But very little of that got in the way of understanding the gist.\nAnd ultimately that's what most machine translation is meant to do: report basic meaning. For any kind of nuance or subtlety, even a large language model may not be able to replicate idiom, so an actual bilingual person is your best bet.\nThe main limitation is probably a lack of languages. Google Translate supports over a hundred \u2014 Firefox Translations does an even dozen: Spanish, Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian Bokmal and Nynorsk, Persian, Portuguese and Russian. That leaves out quite a bit, but remember this is just the first release of a project by a nonprofit and a group of academics \u2014 not a marquee product from a multi-billion-dollar globe-spanning internet empire.\nIn fact, the creators are actively soliciting help by exposing a training pipeline to let \"enthusiasts\" train new models. And they are also soliciting feedback to improve the existing models. This is a usable product, but not a finished one by a long shot!",

        "article": "A former Texas police officer has been convicted of manslaughter on Thursday for fatally shooting a Black woman through a rear window of her home in 2019, a rare conviction of an officer for killing someone also armed with a gun.\nJurors found Aaron Dean not guilty of murder but convicted him of manslaughter in the death of Atatiana Jefferson. The conviction comes more than three years after the white Fort Worth officer shot the 28-year-old woman while responding to a call about an open front door.\nDean, 38, faces up to 20 years in prison on the manslaughter conviction. He would face up to life in prison if convicted of murder. The judge told jurors Wednesday that they could also consider a manslaughter charge.\nThe Tarrant County jury returned the verdict after more than 13 hours of deliberation over two days. That followed six days of testimony and arguments in which the primary dispute was whether Dean knew Jefferson was armed when he shot her. Dean testified that he saw her weapon, while prosecutors alleged the evidence showed otherwise.\nThe case was unusual for the relative speed with which, amid public outrage, the Fort Worth Police Department released video footage of the shooting that took place on October 12, 2019, and arrested Dean. He\u2019d completed the police academy the year before and quit the force without speaking to investigators.\nSince then, the case had been repeatedly postponed amid lawyerly wrangling, the terminal illness of Dean\u2019s lead lawyer and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDean shot Jefferson after police received a call on a nonemergency line. Al Jazeera reporter Tylor Hicks recently spoke to the neighbour who made the call, James Smith, a retired US Army veteran.\nHe told Al Jazeera that he noticed that the door to Jefferson\u2019s house was open and her lights were on, so he wanted to ensure that she was OK.\nAfter Smith learned what happened, he said he fought to raise awareness about Jefferson\u2019s death, against the advice of some in his community. A pastor reportedly told him: \u201cYou need to let God handle it; let someone pick up the torch.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been three years,\u201d Smith replied, \u201cand no one\u2019s picked it up yet.\u201d He feels frustrated by the delays in the murder trial.\nJefferson had been playing video games on the night of the shooting with her nephew, and it emerged at trial that they left the doors open to vent smoke from hamburgers the boy burned.\nBodycam footage showed that Dean and a second officer who responded to the call didn\u2019t identify themselves as police at the house. Dean and Officer Carol Darch testified that they thought the house might have been burglarised and quietly moved into the fenced-off back yard looking for signs of forced entry.\nThere, Dean, whose gun was drawn, fired a single shot through the window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson, who was inside, to show her hands.\nDean testified that he had no choice but to shoot when he saw Jefferson pointing the barrel of a gun directly at him. But under questioning from prosecutors, he acknowledged numerous errors, again and again conceding that actions he took before and after the shooting were \u201cmore bad police work\u201d.\nDarch\u2019s back was to the window when Dean shot, but she testified that he never mentioned seeing a gun before he pulled the trigger and didn\u2019t say anything about the weapon as they rushed in to search the house.\nDean acknowledged on the witness stand that he only said something about the gun after seeing it on the floor inside the house and that he never gave Jefferson first aid.\nJefferson\u2019s 8-year-old nephew Zion Carr was in the room with his aunt when she was shot. Zion testified that Jefferson took out her gun believing there was an intruder in the back yard, but he offered contradictory accounts of whether she pointed the pistol out the window.\nOn the trial\u2019s opening day, the now 11-year-old Zion testified that Jefferson always had the gun pointed down, but in an interview that was recorded soon after the shooting and played in court, he said she had pointed the weapon at the window.",

        "article": "Listen Gift Article Share\nThe Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore appears to be planning to object to a still-unreleased report by the Maryland attorney general into clergy sexual abuse of minors, a spokesman said Friday. The report, by the office of outgoing Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, took nearly four years to complete and tallies more than 600 young victims and 158 abusive priests over 80 years, according to a court filing Thursday.\nBecause the 456-page report includes testimony that resulted from grand jury subpoenas, a judge must approve its release. The filing in Baltimore City Circuit Court requests its release.\nChristian Kendzierski, a spokesman for the archdiocese led by Archbishop William E. Lori, wrote back Friday to The Washington Post\u2019s asking if the church would contest the report\u2019s release.\n\u201cThe Archdiocese does not object to the release of a report which accurately details the heinous crime and sin of child sexual abuse perpetrated by members of the clergy and also fairly and accurately details how the Archdiocese responded to such allegations, even when the response fell far short of how such allegations are handled today,\u201d his statement read. \u201cThe motion filed by the Maryland Attorney General does not reflect the Archdiocese\u2019s current and decades-long strong pastoral response and handling of allegations of child sexual abuse.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe report is the second of its kind, following an explosive one from a Pennsylvania grand jury in 2018 that led to the arrest of priests, early retirement for an archbishop and new policies. It also included many decades-old cases, something victims and their advocates said was essential since in most cases higher-ups were never held responsible and often priests retired and were still paid and remained clergy. Even if statutes of limitation made civil, canonical or criminal cases unfeasible, advocates said, the detailed compiling of how the cases happened and were handled, and the cost to the abused, was a kind of justice.\nOn Friday Kendzierski\u2019s statement said the archdiocese would \u201ccontinue to cooperate with any legal processes relating to the Attorney General\u2019s investigation. The Archdiocese is participating in the court process and understands that the courts rightly expect the law on grand jury materials to be followed and due process to be respected.\u201d\nRequests to the archdiocese for greater clarity weren\u2019t answered late Friday.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear what legal argument the archdiocese might be planning to make. In Pennsylvania, church officials fought the attorney general over the inclusion of specific names of accused clergy who had not been not charged, saying that to name them violates their constitutional rights. For weeks, court and state lawyers were in court arguing about the redacting of names and entire sections and what could be released.\nFrosh spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said, \u201cIt is our hope that the Archdiocese will not oppose release of the report to provide victims long awaited relief and healing.\u201d\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

The jury also ruled that Jones should pay $4.1 million in compensatory damages.\nThe judgment adds to a growing list of rulings and trials racking up costs for Jones, who owes $1.4 billion in a separate Connecticut case brought by eight families of Sandy Hook victims and a first responder.\nJones baselessly repeated after the 2012 mass shooting, in which 26 people were killed, including 20 children, that the incident was staged, and that the families and first responders were \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d\nThe Texas law guiding punitive damages allows plaintiffs to collect up to twice what was awarded in economic compensatory damages, plus up to $750,000. Jurors are not told about this cap and steep verdicts are often reduced by judges.\nBut Judge Gamble ruled that she would enter a judgment for the full amount.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question to me that this is a rare instance, I hope it remains a rare instance, where a defendant intentionally inflicted emotional damage in a manner so unusual that the victims had no other recourse,\u201d Judge Gamble said.\nShe added that the amount should be high enough so it \u201cisn\u2019t affordable\u201d to intentionally inflict this type of emotional damage again.\nJones\u2019 attorney said the Infowars founder will appeal Tuesday\u2019s decision, Reuters reported.\nJudge Gamble also set a March 23, 2023 trial date for another defamation lawsuit against Jones by the father of 6-year old Noah Pozner, who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting.\nIt is unclear how much the families will get from Jones, who has said he has little money to pay the damages. Jones\u2019s company Free Speech Systems, which operates Infowars, filed for bankruptcy protection in July.\nEarlier this week, Elon Musk said he would not restore Jones\u2019 Twitter account, despite allowing other banned individuals, including former President Donald Trump, back onto the platform. Musk, who lost his first born son at 10 weeks of age, said he had \u201cno mercy\u201d for anyone \u201cwho would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame.\u201d\n\u2014 Oliver Darcy and Brian Fung contributed reporting.",

When conditions are right, jellyfish reproduce sexually.\nAlthough many types of jellyfish have some capacity to reverse aging and revert to a larval stage, most lose this ability once they reach sexual maturity, the authors wrote. Not so for T. dohrnii.\n\"We've known about this species being able to do a little evolutionary trickery for maybe 15-20 years,\" said Monty Graham, a jellyfish expert and director of the Florida Institute of Oceanography, who was not involved in the research.\nThis trick earned the species its nickname as the immortal jellyfish, a term Graham admits is a bit hyperbolic.\nThe study was aimed at understanding what made this jellyfish different by comparing the genetic sequence of T. dohrnii to that of Turritopsis rubra, a close genetic cousin that lacks the ability to rejuvenate after sexual reproduction.\nWhat they found is that T. dohrnii has variations in its genome that may make it better at copying and repairing DNA. They also appear to be better at maintaining the ends of chromosomes called telomeres. In humans and other species, telomere length has been shown to shorten with age.\nGraham said the research has no immediate commercial value.\nStory continues\n\"We can't look at it as, hey, we are going to harvest these jellyfish and turn it into a skin cream,\" he said.\nIt has more to do with understanding the processes and protein functionality that helps these jellyfish cheat death.\n\"It's one of those papers that I do think will open up a door to a new line of study that's worth pursuing.\"",

Photo by Bonnie Cash/UPI | License Photo\nJune 28 -- The Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday to reinstate Louisiana's Republican-drawn congressional map, freezing a lower court's ruling that says it violates the Voting Rights Act. The court's decision resets the map for the 2022 midterm election, despite arguments it is racially biased and would dilute the power of Black voters. Advertisement\nLouisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry asked the court to freeze the lower court's opinion.\n\"It is impossible to draw a map without prioritizing race as the predominant factor in order to generate a second majority-minority district, which federal courts have cautioned Louisiana not to do in the past,\" he told justices in court papers.\nRELATED Louisiana governor vetoes congressional district maps drawn by legislature\nThe justices agreed to put the lower court's ruling on hold pending a decision next term on a similar dispute out of Alabama. The three liberal justices, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented in Tuesday's ruling.\nThe map passed Louisiana's legislature and was vetoed in March by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards who said it \"runs afoul of federal law.\"\nAdvertisement\n\"I have vetoed the proposed congressional map drawn by Louisiana's legislature because it does not include a second majority African American district, despite Black voters making up almost a third of Louisianans per the latest U.S. Census data,\" the governor said.\nRELATED Florida enacts new election laws ahead of 2022 midterms\n\"This map is simply not fair to the people of Louisiana and does not meet the standards set forth in the federal Voting Rights Act.\"\nThe Republican-controlled legislature overrode Edwards' veto keeping Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District -- which stretches from Baton Rouge to New Orleans -- the only majority Black district likely to favor Democrats.\nEarlier this month, a federal court in Louisiana blocked the map and ordered state lawmakers to draw a new map with an additional majority-Black congressional district by June 20, in time for the midterm election.

We\u2019re going to use every appeal avenue,\u201d Stella Assange told reporters, calling the decision a \u201ctravesty\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend every waking hour fighting for Julian until he is free, until justice is served.\u201d\nHis brother, Gabriel Shipton, told Reuters the appeal would include new information not previously taken to the courts, including claims made in a report last year of plans to assassinate him.\nOriginally, a British judge ruled Assange, 50, should not be deported, saying his mental health meant he would be at risk of suicide if convicted and held in a maximum security prison.\nBut this was overturned on an appeal after the United States gave a package of assurances, including a pledge he could be transferred to Australia to serve any sentence.\nThe Home Office said the courts had not found that extradition would be incompatible with his human rights, including his right to a fair trial and to freedom of expression, and that he would be treated appropriately.\nThe Australian-born Assange has been involved in a legal fight in Britain for more than a decade and it could now go on for many more months.\nHe has 14 days to appeal to London\u2019s High Court, which must give its approval for a challenge, and he could ultimately seek to take his case to the United Kingdom Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\u2018CHILLING MESSAGE\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019re not at the end of the road here,\u201d Stella Assange said, calling Patel\u2019s decision \u201ca dark day for press freedom and for British democracy\u201d.\nNick Vamos, the former head of extradition at Britain\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service, said verdicts were regularly overturned by the High Court. Assange would be able to claim again it was politically motivated and use new evidence, such as his allegations the CIA had plotted to assassinate him.\nThe CIA has declined to comment on his claims.\n\u201cI think he might get some traction,\u201d Vamos told Reuters.\nALSO READ:",

Armani and guests evacuated to a boat in the harbor.\nThe head of the region's civil protection agency, Salvatore Cocina, said arson was suspected in two wildfires that forced around 30 people to seek refuge in boats or on safer parts of the island. Firefighters used Canadair planes to douse the flames, along with ground teams to protect homes. Authorities said no structures appeared to have been lost.\nThe island's mayor, Vincenzo Campo, told Italian news agency ANSA that two planes were working on putting out the last flames on difficult terrain and that the wind had dropped off.\n\"After the great fear of last evening and the night spent at work, Pantelleria is returning to normal,\" Campo said. \"It seems the worst is over.\"\nLocal officials appealed for any information that would help identify the cause of the blaze, which started in two places 400 metres apart.\nPantelleria, located between Sicily and Tunisia, is a popular beach and trekking destination that includes ancient archaeological sites and natural geographic formations.\nScientists say global warming will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Much of western Europe saw little rain this summer, and drought conditions coupled with hot weather have fueled destructive forest fires.\nSo far this summer, wildfires in Spain have blackened more than 700,000 hectares, the largest area since the European Union started collecting satellite data in 2006.\nThe EU's Earth Observation Program said more torrid weather was forecast for Spain as two \"disastrous\" wildfires burned in the eastern part of the country. The fires in the Mediterranean provinces of Alicante and Castellon have each charred more than 13,000 hectares, the EU agency said.\nMeanwhile, authorities in Portugal reported that a wildfire burning for almost two weeks in the pine forests of Serra da Estrela national park was brought under control. However, officials warned of weather forecasts indicating a dangerous new heat wave would arrive soon.\nHigh temperatures, strong winds and a severe drought helped sustain the blaze in the park, where deep ravines and steep hillsides make firefighting difficult.\nMore than 1,100 firefighters remained in the Serra da Estrela, keeping an eye out for hot spots and embers that might be blown into untouched forest, the Civil Protection Agency, a government department, said.\nThe blaze charred more than 26,000 hectares of woodland, according to European Union data -- about one-fourth of the park's area.\nOn Wednesday, the fire's perimeter measured 160 kilometers, emergency officials said, and jumped 125-meter-wide firebreaks that had been cleared since the area's last major blaze, in 2017.\nFire officials said that was an indication the country is fighting a \"new generation\" of wildfires that are harder to stop amid the consequences of climate change.\nTemperatures in Portugal were due to start climbing, reaching 39 degrees Celsius in inland areas on Saturday, as the country endures its third heat wave of the summer.",

Aarey Metro Car Shed: Supreme Court Tells MMRCL To Strictly Abide by Undertaking That No Trees Would Be Cut in Aarey Colony.\nThe law officer said let the tree felling committee decide on the request of MMRCL on cutting of the tree and the decision would be dependent on the order of this court.\nA senior advocate appearing for those opposed to felling of trees said they have also filed an interim plea. \u201cWe will deal with these two IAs tomorrow,\u201d the bench said. Aarey Metro Car Shed: Congress Environment Cell Activists Protest Near Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde's Thane House.\nThe MMRCL had on August 5 this year told the apex court that no trees have been cut in Aarey colony since October 2019. On August 24, the top court had directed the MMRCL to strictly abide by its undertaking that no trees will be cut there and warned that any violation would result in strict action.\nThe counsel had said the work for the metro car shed is continuing, and as a result, the court may be presented with a fate accompli. The apex court had in 2019 taken suo motu cognisance of a letter petition addressed to the Chief Justice of India by law student Rishav Ranjan seeking a stay on the felling of trees in the colony.\nThe apex court had restrained the authorities from felling any more trees after the Solicitor General submitted on behalf of the State of Maharashtra that no further trees will be cut. The felling of trees in the colony has been opposed by green activists and residents.\nIn their first cabinet meeting held hours after coming to power, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis had taken the first step towards overturning the previous Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government's decision of relocating the proposed car shed project from Aarey Colony.\nIncidentally, Thackeray, immediately after becoming the chief minister in November 2019, had announced a stay on the construction of the proposed project and later ordered it be shifted to Kanjurmarg.\nThe Bombay High Court in October 2019 refused to declare Aarey Colony a forest and declined to quash the Mumbai municipal corporation's decision to allow felling of over 2,600 trees in the green zone to set up the metro car shed.",

        "article": "A British citizen was sentenced Monday by an Iraqi court to 15 years in prison on charges of attempting to smuggle artefacts out of the country, in a case that has attracted international attention.\nThe verdict handed down to retired geologist Jim Fitton, shocked the court in Baghdad, including his defence attorney. He and his family have argued that Fitton, 66, had no criminal intent.\n\u201cI thought the worst case scenario would be one year, with suspension,\u201d Fitton\u2019s lawyer Thair Soud, visibly shocked, told The Associated Press.\nA German national tried with Fitton was found not to have criminal intent in the case and will be released.\nBut Judge Jabir Abd Jabir found that by picking up the items, found to be artefacts dating older than 200 years, according to a technical government investigation, and intending to transport them out of the country, Fitton had criminal intent to smuggle them.\nThe trial has grabbed international attention at a time when Iraq seeks to open up its nascent tourism sector.\nThe two men first appeared in court on May 15 wearing yellow detainees' uniforms, telling judges they had not acted with criminal intent and had no idea they might have broken local laws.\nFitton said he \u201csuspected\u201d the items he collected were ancient fragments, but that \u201cat the time I didn\u2019t know about Iraqi laws,\u201d or that taking the shards was not permitted. Fitton said as a geologist he was in the habit of collecting such fragments as a hobby and had no intention to sell them.\nThe judge, however, did not consider Soud\u2019s arguments that laid out Fitton\u2019s ignorance of Iraqi laws and the value of the items he picked up. Fitton and the German national, Volker Waldman, were arrested at Baghdad's airport on March 20 after airport security discovered the items in their luggage. They had been part of a tourism expedition around the country\u2019s ancient sites.\nFitton\u2019s family grew worried when he did not arrive on a scheduled flight back to Kuala Lumpur, where he resides with his wife, on March 20. They later learned that Fitton, a well-travelled geologist for oil and gas companies, had been taken to an airport holding cell where he was still being detained, Fitton\u2019s daughter Leila told the AP last month.\nFrustrated by perceived inaction on the part of the British Foreign Office to intervene and assist in Fitton\u2019s case, his family started a petition that has garnered over 100,000 signatures. The British diplomatic mission in Baghdad has not commented on its involvement in the case and the British consul in Iraq, who attended the court session Monday, left following the sentencing without making any comments.\nIn total, 12 fragments of pottery and other shards were found in Fitton\u2019s possession by Iraqi authorities, all of them collected as souvenirs, Fitton\u2019s family says, during a group tourism expedition to Eridu, an ancient Mesopotamian site in what is now Dhi Qar province.\nWaldman\u2019s defence team has said the German tourist had been carrying the pieces for Fitton but that he did not pick them up from the site. Both men were charged with smuggling based on the country\u2019s antiquities laws.\nSoud said he intends to appeal the sentence immediately. It is not clear if Fitton can serve out his sentence in his home country as this would require a bilateral agreement between Iraq and the UK.\nBased on Iraqi law, both men could have faced the death penalty, an outcome that legal experts said from the beginning was unlikely.",

His lawyers didn\u2019t respond to phone messages or emails Thursday and prosecutors declined to comment on the nature of the court appearance.\nJohn Elmore, an attorney for the families of two of the 10 Black people who were killed in the shooting, said Gendron\u2019s lawyers disclosed in recent weeks that he planned to plead guilty to all of the counts in the state indictment and waive his right to appeal. Elmore said he was willing to confirm the plan following news reports about the expected plea Thursday.\nTerrence M. Connors, who is representing relatives of seven of the victims, said Gendron\u2019s lawyers also briefed him about the plan.\n\u201cWe had known for some time that it is likely that on Monday, he will enter a plea of guilty to each and every count in the 25-count indictment, and that when sentencing comes, he will receive a sentence of life in prison without parole,\u201d Connors said.\nFILE - This image provided by the Erie County District Attorney's Office shows Payton Gendron. Relatives of those killed and wounded in a racist mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket in May have been told that Gendron will plead guilty to state charges next week, a lawyer for the families said Thursday. Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS\nA grand jury in June indicted Gendron on charges of murder and attempted murder, as well as state domestic terrorism and hate crime charges that would carry a mandatory life sentence.\nGendron, who is white, also faces separate federal hate crime charges that could carry the death penalty.\nGendron drove about three hours to Buffalo from his home in Conklin, New York, intending to kill as many Black people as possible at a store he chose because of its location in a predominantly Black neighborhood. Shortly before opening fire with an AR-15-style rifle on May 14, he posted documents that outlined his white supremacist views and revealed he had been planning the attack for months.\nThe victims, who ranged in age from 32 to 86, included eight customers, the store security guard and a church deacon who drove shoppers to and from the store with their groceries. Three people were wounded but survived.\nA spokeswoman for Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said the office could not comment on the reported plea because of a court-imposed gag order.\nConnors, who is working with civil rights attorney Ben Crump on the case, said those involved agreed not to disclose the development publicly until the hearing was entered into the court schedule, which happened Thursday.\n\u201cThis is but one chapter of accountability for this horrible tragedy. And there are more chapters to come,\u201d Connors said. \u201cThe families right now are focused on doing what they can to bring something positive to East Buffalo out of this horrible tragedy.\u201d\nAsked about the reported plea at a news conference to discuss preparations for an impending winter storm, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Byron Brown said the families need justice.\n\u201cIt is going to be difficult for the families, it will open up that wound again,\u201d Brown said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s good that this individual is pleading guilty.\u201d\n___\nFor more AP coverage of the mass shooting: https://apnews.com/hub/buffalo-supermarket-shooting\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Now the Indian businessman, a college dropout who first tried his luck as a diamond trader before turning to coal, has become the world\u2019s third-richest person.\nIt\u2019s the first time an Asian person has broken into the top three of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 fellow citizen Mukesh Ambani and China\u2019s Jack Ma never made it that far. With a $137.4 billion fortune, Adani has overtaken France\u2019s Bernard Arnault and now trails just Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos of the US in the ranking.\nAdani, 60, has spent the past few years expanding his coal-to-ports conglomerate, venturing into everything from data centers to cement, media and alumina. The group now owns India\u2019s largest private-sector port and airport operator, city-gas distributor and coal miner. While its Carmichael mine in Australia has been criticized by environmentalists, it pledged in November to invest $70 billion in green energy to become the world\u2019s largest renewable-energy producer.\nAs his empire has expanded to one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates fueling the remarkable wealth gains, concerns have grown over the rapid growth. Adani\u2019s deals spree has been predominantly funded with debt and his empire is \u201cdeeply over-leveraged,\u201d CreditSights said in a report this month.\nSome lawmakers and market watchers have also raised concerns over opaque shareholder structures and a lack of analyst coverage at Adani Group companies. Yet the shares have soared \u2014 some of them more than 1,000% since 2020, with valuations hitting 750 times earnings \u2014 as the tycoon focused on areas that Prime Minister Narendra Modi deems crucial to meeting India\u2019s long-term goals.\nThe pivot to green energy and infrastructure has won investments from firms including Warburg Pincus and TotalEnergies SE, helping Adani enter the echelons previously dominated by US tech moguls. The surge in coal in recent months has further turbocharged his ascent.\nAll told, Adani has added $60.9 billion to his fortune in 2022 alone, five times more than anyone else. He first overtook Ambani as the richest Asian in February, became a centibillionaire in April and surpassed Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Bill Gates as the world\u2019s fourth-richest person last month.\nAdani was able to move past some of the world\u2019s richest US billionaires partly because they\u2019ve recently boosted their philanthropy. Gates said in July he was transferring $20 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, while Warren Buffett has already donated more than $35 billion to the charity.\nThe two, along with Gates\u2019s ex-wife Melinda French Gates, started the Giving Pledge initiative in 2010, vowing to give away most of their fortunes in their lifetimes. The billions of dollars spent on philanthropy has pushed them lower on the Bloomberg wealth ranking. Gates is now fifth and Buffett is sixth.\nAdani, too, has increased his charitable giving. He pledged in June to donate $7.7 billion for social causes to mark his 60th birthday.",

But citizens are required to have proof they have taken a covid test within the last 72 hours in order to enter areas like malls and offices \u2014 or even to use subways and buses.\nAuthorities have built 15,000 testing sites and trained thousands of workers to swab throats. Still, long queues amid early summer heat became a common sight on Wednesday and Thursday, with some people saying they queued for two hours.\nOne picture posted on social media showed a sign at a booth warning of a 4-and-a-half hour wait.\n\"I left the lockdown nightmare only to enter the 72-hour PCR testing nightmare,\" said one Shanghai resident on Weibo, declining to provide her name.\n\"It is troublesome, but we have no choice,\" said another, named Xu Xiaojun. \"This is for everyone's good.\"\nXia Kejia, a city official responsible for PCR screening, apologised for the queues at a news conference on Thursday and said more workers would be deployed and booths' opening times extended to try to resolve the issues.\nOther cities including Beijing and Shenzhen have imposed similar requirements under a national zero-covid policy that aims to cut off every infection chain.\nDespite the discontent caused by Shanghai's stringent curbs, China has vowed to stick with its approach. It says the zero-covid policy is needed to save lives and prevent its healthcare system from being swamped, even as much of the world tries to return to normal despite ongoing infections.\nThat increasingly means covid testing is becoming a feature of daily life. China's goal is to have testing sites within a 15-minute walk for everyone in large cities.\nThe ruling Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper published a commentary on Thursday in which it said the zero-covid policy was most appropriate for China's situation. It also carried a front-page article describing how Shanghai was returning to normal.\n\"Great, phased results have been achieved in the defence of Shanghai,\" it said.\nOn edge\nStill, some 2.5 million in the city remain under lockdown and the consequences of testing positive are the same as before. All positive cases will be sent to central quarantine and close contacts \u2014 including \u2014 barred from leaving home.\nThis has left many Shanghai residents remaining on edge. Two told Reuters that they were informed on Thursday by their compounds that they were required to go back under lockdown and undergo daily testing.\nOn Thursday, videos shared on social media showed people fleeing the luxury International Finance Centre mall in the Lujiazui financial district after it stopped people from entering or exiting - a common practice at venues when a positive covid test result is found.\nThe IFC mall later issued a notice saying that it had reopened at 12.30 pm local time after carrying out a full disinfection without confirming whether there had been a positive covid test at the site. The mall did not respond to calls seeking further comment.\nOther residents still under lockdown expressed mounting frustration over their situation.\nAden Hogan, a British citizen, said his Shanghai compound had not been released as two \"abnormal\" test results had been found among his neighbours this week. While they were later told that these were false positives, they were still being made to undergo multiple tests and not allowed to leave, he said.\n\"People have done nothing wrong. We've taken the test anytime that they have said...and they\u2019ve been forcing us to have tests in the middle of the night. It makes you feel like a criminal.\"\nShanghai reported eight new asymptomatic coronavirus cases for June 1 and five new symptomatic cases. On Thursday, officials said they upgraded four areas to medium-risk after finding seven new coronavirus cases.",

The protocol, designed to preserve free trade on the island of Ireland, is part of the broader trade deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson negotiated with the European Union when Britain left the 27-nation bloc.\nBut the arrangement has proved politically damaging for Johnson because it treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom, potentially weakening the province\u2019s historic links with Britain. Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party has refused to return to the region\u2019s power-sharing government until the protocol is amended to address those concerns.\nThe opposition Labour Party, and even some members of Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, say unilaterally changing the protocol would be illegal and would damage Britain\u2019s standing with other countries because its part of a treaty considered binding under international law.\n\u201cBreaking international law to rip up the Prime Minister\u2019s own treaty is damaging to everything the U.K. and Conservatives stand for,\u201d opponents of the bill said in a note being circulated among Conservative lawmakers, according to the Financial Times.\nArrangements for Northern Ireland \u2014 the only part of the U.K. that shares a land border with an EU nation \u2014 have proved the thorniest issue in Britain\u2019s divorce from the bloc, which became final at the end of 2020.\nThe 1998 Good Friday agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland was underpinned by the fact that both the U.K. and Ireland were EU members, allowing goods and people to flow freely across the border.\nWhile both sides are committed to keeping the border open, other competing interests have made that difficult to achieve.\nThe EU, focused on protecting its internal market, wants to ensure that all goods flowing into the bloc meet its standards. Britain is trying to assert its newly won independence from the EU while preserving the union of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\nAfter a conversation with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said \u201cunilateral action is damaging to mutual trust and a formula for uncertainty.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s executive arm is expected to give a more detailed response once the U.K.\u2019s plans have been released.\nIreland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, also spoke with Truss on Monday and accused the U.K. government of deliberately ratcheting up \u201ctension with an EU seeking compromise.\u201d\nAssociated Press reporter Samuel Petrequin in Brussels contributed to this story.\nFollow AP's coverage of Brexit at https://apnews.com/hub/brexit.",

        "article": "Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz enters the courtroom for a sentencing hearing Tuesday at the Broward County Courthouse.\nImage credit: Amy Beth Bennett\nThe shooter who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 has officially been sentenced to life in prison after an emotional two-day hearing in which family members of the victims confronted him in court.\nIn a Florida courtroom on Wednesday, Nikolas Cruz, now 24, was formally sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for each of 17 charges of first-degree murder. He also received a life sentence for each count of attempted first-degree murder, one for each of the 17 he wounded.\nAs Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer read the sentence \u2014 one for each count, naming each of his victims \u2014 the survivors and family members who had gathered in the courtroom held hands and wept.\n\u201cYou all have been so strong and patient and graceful throughout this process, and I can\u2019t help but think how I would behave or respond if I were in your shoes. The way that you have behaved so gracefully, and showed extraordinary restraint throughout this process, is something that I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Scherer said.\nThe hearing gave families an opportunity to speak directly to Cruz himself, and many chose to do so, expressing their grief and fury over the loss of their loved ones.\nLori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa was killed, said she hopes that Cruz is \u201cmiserable for the rest of your pathetic life. My hope for you is that the pain of what you did to my family burns and traumatizes you every day.\u201d\nOn Feb. 14, 2018, Cruz returned to the high school in Parkland, Fla., where he had been a student. Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle, he stalked through hallways of a school building for about six minutes, killing 14 students and three staff members. He escaped from the scene by dropping his gun and running among the fleeing students, authorities later said, and was caught by police about an hour later.\nWith a confession, eyewitnesses and surveillance camera footage, a conviction had been all but assured. Cruz pleaded guilty last October.\nAt his three-month-long trial, which began earlier this year, a Fort Lauderdale jury was tasked with recommending a sentence. They had only two options: life in prison or the death penalty.\nFrom the beginning, his defense team had one goal \u2014 avoiding the death penalty. In the end, they were successful, convincing a jury that his mother\u2019s abuse of alcohol and drugs while she was pregnant with him had left Cruz mentally impaired.\nGrief and fury in the victim impact statements\nThe judge had no power to change Cruz\u2019s sentence, but over a two-day hearing this week, Scherer allowed those affected by the shooting \u2013 both those who survived and family members of those who did not \u2013 to address the gunman and comment on the sentencing.\nFor hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, they expressed their grief and rage. Many denounced the jury\u2019s decision to allow Cruz to avoid the death penalty.\nAnd for the first time, they spoke directly to Cruz, something they had not been allowed to do during the trial.\nThey called him a monster, a sociopath, a \u201cmurdering bastard.\u201d One wished for him to \u201cburn in hell.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea that you, a coldblooded killer, can actually live each day, eat your meals and put your head down at night \u2013 it seems completely unjust,\u201d said Stacey Lippel, a teacher who was wounded in the shooting. \u201cThe only comfort I have is that your life in prison will be filled with horror and fear.\u201d\nOther families directed their anger at Florida\u2019s legal processes and at Cruz\u2019s defense attorneys, including lead attorney Melisa McNeill.\nMax Schachter, whose 14-year old son Alex was killed at the school, said that law was unfair to the victims and their families. And he accused McNeill of falsely claiming that Cruz had not received adequate mental health treatment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for you to make a statement that is an outright lie,\u201d Schachter said. \u201cYou\u2019re making the mental health crisis in America worse by misrepresenting what happened to the Parkland murderer.\u201d\nEventually, some statements grew so heated that McNeill asked the judge to intervene. \u201cI did my job and every member of his team did their job, Judge. And we should not be personally attacked for that,\u201d she said.\nThe judge refused.\nSome have called for Florida to change death sentence rules\nCruz\u2019s sentence of life in prison has renewed calls for Florida\u2019s state legislature to change the state\u2019s rules around death sentences.\nThe state once required a simple majority for a death sentence \u2013 or seven jurors on a panel of 12 \u2013 but after a series of court decisions, in 2016 Florida began requiring unanimous verdicts.\n\u201cWhen you murder in cold blood 17 innocent people, there\u2019s no other punishment that meets the gravity of that crime. And to have one juror holdout on that was a travesty,\u201d said Gov. Ron DeSantis at a recent gubernatorial debate. \u201cSo, yes, I\u2019m going to ask the Florida legislature to amend that statute.\u201d\nIn their statements this week, some Parkland families joined the call for the state legislature to act to allow a majority or supermajority vote for a death sentence.\n\u201cThis would be more fair to the victims,\u201d said Tony Montalto, whose 14-year-old daughter Gina was killed.",

        "article": "The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday filed federal hate crime charges against a white supremacist accused of killing 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York, last month, saying he was driven by a desire to \"prevent Black people from replacing white people.\" Payton Gendron faces 26 counts of hate crimes and firearms offenses, according to the charges.\nThe complaint contains chilling details about the May 14 shooting, including a moment when Gendron turned to a white male victim who had been shot in the leg and said \"sorry\" before moving on, according to a sworn statement filed by an FBI agent. \"We will be relentless in our efforts to combat hate crimes and support communities terrorized by them, and to hold accountable those who perpetrate them,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland, who traveled to the site of the shooting on Wednesday and met with victims' families.\nGendron, 18, could potentially face the death penalty if found guilty. Garland declined to say whether it would be sought if Gendron is convicted. Gendron already faces the possibility of life in prison without parole on 25 New York state charges, including first- and second-degree murder and domestic terrorism motivated by hate. He has pleaded not guilty.\nA lawyer representing Gendron in the state case could not be reached for comment. Gendron allegedly killed 10 people and wounded three at the Tops Friendly Markets in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo before police said he surrendered to officers inside the grocery store.\nThe gunman broadcast the attack in real time on the Twitch livestreaming service and apparently posted a white supremacist rant before the attack saying that he had been inspired by previous racially motivated mass killings. According to the criminal complaint, the semi-automatic rifle used in the assault had the names of others who committed mass shootings written on it, as well as phrases such as \"Here's your reparations!\" and \"The Great Replacement.\"\n\"The Great Replacement\" refers to a false conspiracy theory that various elites are engineering the replacement of white populations with non-white immigrants. The FBI said it had uncovered a hand-written note in Gendron's bedroom in which he apologized to his family for committing \"this attack\" and said he had to do it \"for the future of the White race.\"\nThe FBI also located sketches of what appeared to be the layout of the supermarket. The Buffalo shooting and a mass shooting just 10 days later at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have prompted a bipartisan effort in the Senate to enact tougher gun laws, though there were signs on Wednesday of snags on passing a bill.",

The hard-to-evaluate performance against the world\u2019s 170th-ranked team came in a CONCACAF Nations League match played 164 days before the Americans\u2019 opener in Qatar.\nJust three warmup matches remain before U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter picks his World Cup roster.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m in a good spot,\u201d said Ferreira, a son of former Colombian national team midfielder David Ferreira, the 2010 Major League Soccer MVP. \u201cI\u2019m not going to focus on the goals because I know they will come. Just having a good game will do the job.\u201d\nFerreira is competing for a roster spot and playing time with Ricardo Pepi, Haji Wright, Josh Sargent, Jordan Pefok and Daryl Dike.\nAfter an array of misfires, Ferreira put the 15th-ranked U.S. ahead in the 43rd minute, then added goals in the 54th, 56th and 78th to give him seven in 12 international matches. His four goals matched Landon Donovan, Joe-Max Moore, Buff Donelli and Archie Stark.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain validation that you get as a striker when you do hit the back of the net,\u201d Berhalter said.\nPaul Arriola added a goal in the 62nd as the Americans stretched their home unbeaten streak to 26 games since a September 2019 loss to Mexico, matching the team record set from 2013-15.\nOn a 96-degree evening, stars Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams didn\u2019t dress for the No. 15 U.S., which faced a Spice Boys team winless since beating the U.S. Virgin Islands in March 2021. The Americans had 67% possession and outshot Grenada 25-3, including 10-0 in the first half.\nFerreira got the first goal when Arriola crossed and the ball deflected off Kayden Harrack. Ferreira cut to the center and beat goalkeeper Jason Belfon inside the far post with a left-foot shot from 8 yards. The U.S. had entered with just one goal from the run of play by a forward in 13 games.\nFerreira doubled the lead with a right-footed shot inside the far post when he sprinted behind the defense as Arriola fed him, then beat Belfon to the far post with a 14-yard right foot shot after Kellyn Acosta played a corner kick on the ground.\nSecond-half sub Brenden Aaronson pulled Belfon off his line for Ferreira\u2019s fourth, leaving him a 6-yard tap with his left foot into an open goal.\nArriola, Ferreira\u2019s Dallas teammate, scored from inside the 6-yard box from Luca de la Torre\u2019s pass, his 10th international goal.\nCameron Carter-Vickers started in his international competitive debut and joined Aaron Long to become the 20th center back pairing in 53 games since Berhalter was hired in December 2018. The U.S. made eight changes from Sunday\u2019s 0-0 exhibition draw against Uruguay,\nMalik Tillman, a 20-year-old attacker who switched to the Americans from Germany last month, made his competitive debut at the start of the second half when he replaced Weston McKennie.\nThe unusual prep schedule was caused by FIFA\u2019s 2010 decision to stage the tournament in Qatar, a vote the U.S. Justice Department said was impacted by bribes paid to executive committee members of soccer\u2019s governing body.\nIn 2015, FIFA moved the tournament to winter from its traditional June/July slot, a shift into the middle of the European club season that will limit pre-tournament training to one week and eliminated the U.S. Soccer Federation\u2019s usual sendoff series.\nThe Americans play at El Salvador on Tuesday in the Nations League and plan exhibitions in Europe on Sept. 23 and 27, likely against Asian opponents. The U.S. opens the World Cup against No. 18 Wales on Nov. 21, faces No. 5 England in a Black Friday matchup four days later and finishes the first round against No. 21 Iran on Nov. 29.\nNotes: GK Ethan Horvath and Wright didn\u2019t play, perhaps leaving them to start at El Salvador. \u2026 MF Gio Reyna, sidelined by a leg injury since April 8, was at the training camp though not on the roster. His father, former U.S. captain Claudio Reyna, is sporting director of Austin\u2019s MLS team.\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP\nBrandishing a meat cleaver, two bearded men said in the video that they were avenging an insult to the prophet Mohammed caused by the victim.\nThey also alluded to Nupur Sharma, a former spokesperson for the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, whose remarks about the prophet earlier this month triggered domestic and international outrage.\nIndia\u2019s home minister, Amit Shah, said in a tweet that federal police had taken over the investigation into \u201cthe brutal murder\u201d of Kanhaiya Lal Teli, giving the victim\u2019s full name.\n\u201cThe involvement of any organisation and international links will be thoroughly investigated,\u201d Shah said.\nLate on Wednesday, a spokesperson from Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry rejected reports in some Indian media that linked the suspects to a Pakistan-based organisation.\nThe two assailants had slashed Teli\u2019s head and throat in an attack while the tailor was taking measurements, according to Bhawarlal Thoda, a city administrator in Udaipur.\nAccording to Thoda, the tailor had been detained over a social media post in support of the BJP spokesperson that was traced to his mobile telephone, and that after being released Teli had told police on 15 June that he was being threatened by some group.\n\u201cTerrorists executed my father in the most shocking way, the country must stand with our family to demand justice,\u201d the victim\u2019s son, Yash, told Reuters after his father\u2019s body was cremated on Wednesday.\nHe said the culprits should be tried and sentenced to death, and denied that his father has made any remarks that would be offensive to other religions.\nPoliticians and prominent Islamic preachers condemned the killing.\n\u201cThe incident has shocked followers of Islam, the heinous act committed by two men is absolutely un-Islamic,\u201d said Maulana Ahmed Siddiqui, a Muslim cleric based in Udaipur.\nAuthorities said they had suspended internet services in several parts of Rajasthan to prevent circulation of the video.\n\u201cThe mood is tense and almost all shops are closed today,\u201d Thoda said. The city of about half a million people is one of the major tourist draws in the desert state, and is known for its luxurious hotels, including the well-known Taj Lake Palace.\nThe funeral procession Kanhaiya Lal in Udaipur. Photograph: EPA\nIn another video clip posted online, one of the assailants also went on to threaten the prime minister, Narendra Modi, saying their blade would find him too.\nThe federal government late on Wednesday asked social media platforms to immediately remove content that encourages, glorifies or justifies the killing.\nThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a notice that the removal was necessary \u201cto prevent any incitement and disruption of public order and to restore public peace and harmony\u201d.\nHardline Hindu organisations held protests in the capital, New Delhi, to condemn the killing of Teli and more protests were planned on Thursday.\nIndia has a long history of religious violence, and thousands of people have been killed since the country became independent from British colonial rule in 1947.\nModi\u2019s pursuit of a \u201cHindu first\u201d agenda since coming to power in 2014 has stoked tensions in a country where Muslims make up about 13% of its 1.4 billion people.\nEarlier this month the BJP suspended Sharma from the party and expelled another official but the furore has not died down.\nModi has not commented on the incident in Udaipur. But former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who belongs to the BJP, blamed the Congress Party, now running the state, for the \u201ccommunal frenzy and violence\u201d that has arisen there.\nRaje said \u201csuch acts can occur because the state government provides tacit support to criminals.\u201c\nWhile Congress has championed secular values in India since independence, the BJP has cast it as a pro-Muslim party in order to draw Hindus away from its main opposition.\nRajasthan, with a population of about 69 million people, is just one of two Indian states where Congress holds a majority in the state legislature and it is due to hold elections next year.",

The GNU did not announce the decision, which circulated widely in local and social media, but the Oil Ministry later welcomed the move in a statement.\nSeparately, NOC said it was resuming oil exports from two ports and hoping to restart output at closed fields, signalling a possible end to a blockade by eastern forces imposed as a tactic to drive Dbeibah from office. Access to state oil revenue through NOC and the Central Bank of Libya has been the main prize for sparring factions since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that led to years of chaos and violence in the North African country.\nIn March, the eastern-based parliament appointed a new government under Fathi Bashagha to take over in Tripoli, but Dbeibah refused to step down. Libya's Oil Minister Mohamed Oun, who has feuded with Sanalla, said the NOC board changes were \"an important step to preserve oil wealth\".\nLibya's oil blockade has reduced output by 850,000 barrels per day at a time of global supply constriction and reduced fuel supplies to power stations, adding to electricity cuts that have sparked protests across the country. The leadership of NOC is not among the \"sovereign positions\" that require broad agreement among Libya's rival political institutions to change.\nHowever, with the parliament challenging the legitimacy of Dbeibah's government, any move by him to change the NOC leadership could prompt opposition.",

As in those rulings, judges pointed to the addition in the 1980s of a memorial at the site.\nThe case went to federal judges after courts in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt ruled in 2019 and 2020 against plaintiff Michael Duellmann. He had argued that the sculpture was \u201ca defamation of and insult to the Jewish people\u201d that has \u201ca terrible effect up to this day,\u201d and has suggested moving it the nearby Luther House museum.\nPlaced on the church about four meters above ground level, the sculpture depicts people identifiable as Jews suckling the teats of a sow while a rabbi lifts the animal\u2019s tail. In 1570, after the Protestant Reformation, an inscription referring to an anti-Jewish tract by Luther was added.\nIn 1988, a memorial was set into the ground below, referring to the persecution of Jews and the 6 million people who died during the Holocaust. In addition, a sign gives information about the sculpture in German and English.\nThe federal court found that, viewed in isolation, the original statue \u201cderides and denigrates Judaism as a whole,\u201d but that the parish remedied the legal situation by adding the memorial explaining its historical background. That, it added, meant that the parish had distanced itself from the \u201cdefamatory and antisemitic message\u201d of the statue.\nDespite the defamatory nature of the original statue, \u201cthe legal system does not demand its removal,\u201d the federal court said. It argued there was more than one way to remedy the problem, and a memorial pointing to the Christian church\u2019s antisemitic mentality over centuries was one such possibility.\nGermany\u2019s main Jewish group argued for the memorial to be reworked, and the regional Lutheran bishop signaled that the church will do so.\nThe head of the Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the court\u2019s decision to allow the statue to stay was understandable but argued that the memorial and sign don\u2019t contain \u201can unequivocal condemnation of the antisemitic sculpture.\u201d\n\u201cBoth the Wittenberg parish and the churches as a whole must find a clear and appropriate solution for handling antisemitic sculptures,\u201d Schuster said. \u201cThe defamation of Jews by the churches must belong in the past once and for all.\u201d\nRegional bishop Friedrich Kramer said the church would support the \u201cfurther development\u201d of the memorial. He said there is a consensus that the memorial and sign \u201ctoday no longer satisfy the aspiration to break the effect\u201d of the antisemitic statue.\n\u201cFor us as a church, there can be no question that we face our history with all its misdeeds, and our handling of it,\u201d he said.\nPlaintiff Duellmann told German news agency dpa that neither the federal nor the lower courts \u201creally took seriously the propaganda effect, the poisoning effect on society\u201d of the statue. He plans to take the case to Germany\u2019s highest court, the Federal Constitutional Court.",

        "article": "Reports from this week specify how Microsoft Corp has stated that it will not resist efforts for unionisation from its employees. This was confirmed by Microsoft President Brad Smith on Thursday, June 2. Clearly, this was indicating the increasing receptiveness in the tech industry that has appeared unconcerned about organised labour for a while now.\nFrom a blog post posted Thursday, the tech company confirmed that it recognises the legal right of its workers to form or join a union. However, they pointed out, that the workers would never require \u2018to organise to have a dialogue.\u2019 Evidently, this statement is somewhat opposed to the history of recent uneasiness from employees at various companies in the tech sector.\nMoreover, a small collection of workers in the division of Activision Blizzard voted in favour of unionising in May. As we know, Microsoft Corp is taking over the \u2018Call of Duty\u2019 videogame maker. As a response to the vote, Activision stated that it is under the impression that 19 employees should not necessarily have the ability to make a decision that would impact a bigger group of employees at the videogame maker.\nInstances of anti-union efforts by tech giants:\nFor a while now, Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon.com Inc has been against unionisation efforts by its warehouse workers. Moreover, the company was accused last month of threatening its staff over a union vote, leading to workers hesitating to unionise in some of its warehouses. However, Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse in New York City appeared to successfully form a union weeks back, despite the company spending large sums of money in anti-union efforts in the last couple of years.\nOther tech giants such as Apple have also appeared somewhat opposed to efforts to unionisations as it similarly took steps towards combatting unionisation. Resultantly, workers at an Atlanta Apple store withdrew their request for a union vote, unlike its Maryland location where the vote is set for this month.\nMicrosoft President Smith stated how \u2018recent unionisations campaigns\u2019 in the US, especially in the tech industry inspired them to take this step. This led them to concluding that \u2018inevitably these issues\u2019 would reach more businesses, possibly Microsoft as well.\nAdditionally, he noted that the company holds the belief that neither the employees, or its other stakeholders would gain anything by being against \u2018lawful efforts\u2019 to take part in activities such as unionisation.",

Andrew Cuomo, reads that ''no gun industry member ... shall knowingly or recklessly create, maintain or contribute to a condition in New York state that endangers the safety or health of the public through the sale, manufacturing, importing or marketing of a qualified product.''\nCiting a New York Times report, Steur was critically wounded in the April 12 attack, which took place on the Manhattan-bound N train.\nIn the shooting, suspect Frank R. James, 62, reportedly injured at least 30 people with a Glock pistol he had legally purchased from an Ohio gun shop.\nJames pleaded not guilty to terrorism and weapons charges in May. If convicted, he could face a maximum punishment of life in prison.\nOn the morning commute that April day, James set off smoke grenades in a crowded subway car and then fired at least 33 shots with a handgun, according to police.\nAlso, citing Newsmax reports from then, New York City police recovered a Glock 17 9 mm handgun, three more ammunition magazines and a hatchet, along with a credit card bearing James' name and keys to a van he had rented.\nIn her lawsuit against Glock and its Austrian parent company, Glock Ges.m.b.H, Steur seeks compensation for her injuries.\nHer primary argument: The company's marketing and distribution strategies allowed the suspect to acquire a dangerous product and then use it in a criminal manner.\nIn the complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Steur's lawyers assert that ''the defendants' marketing and distribution practices made it far more likely that criminals, including Frank James, would obtain their weapons.''\nThe lawsuit language continues: ''Defendants are aware that by over-saturating the market with guns, the guns will go to the secondary markets that serve purchasers with a criminal intent, such as James.''\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, wants to tighten the state's already restrictive gun laws.\nAs a potential first step, she's calling for legislators to raise the minimum age to buy AR-15-style weapons from 18 to 21, according to the Times.",

The Federal Network Agency said it was monitoring the situation.\nSpot gas prices rose in Europe, a sign of jitters over possible further effects of the war on supplies of Russian gas, which powers industry and generates electricity on the continent.\nThe European Union has outlined plans to reduce dependence on Russian gas by two-thirds by year\u2019s end. Economists say a complete cutoff would deal a severe blow to the economy, consumers and gas-intensive industries.\nHigh energy prices are already contributing to record inflation of 8.1% in the 19 countries that use the euro.\nGas demand has fallen after the end of the winter heating season, but European utilities are racing to refill storage ahead of next winter with prices high and supplies uncertain.\n\u201cGas supplies to the Nord Stream gas pipeline can currently be provided in the amount of up to 100 million cubic meters per day the planned volume of 167 million cubic meters per day,\u201d Gazprom said in a statement.\nIt did not provide a timeline for the planned drop in gas flows.\nSiemens Energy said a gas turbine that powers a compressor station on the pipeline had been in service for more than 10 years and had been taken to Montreal for a scheduled overhaul. But because of sanctions imposed by Canada, the company has been unable to return the equipment to the customer, Gazprom.\n\u201cAgainst this background we informed the Canadian and German government and are working on a sustainable solution,\u201d Siemens Energy said in a statement.\nAlso Tuesday, the German government said it is making an emergency loan to a former subsidiary of Gazprom to prevent it from bankruptcy and safeguard the nation\u2019s gas supply.\nGermany put a government agency in charge of Gazprom Germania in April, saying the move was temporary to bring \u201corder to the conditions\u201d at the company after the Kremlin-controlled parent company cut ties with its subsidiary.\nGazprom Germania, which plays a central role in the trade, transport and storage of natural gas in Germany and neighboring countries, was subsequently slapped with sanctions by Russia in a tit-for-tat move for Western sanctions over Ukraine.\nDpa quoted unnamed government officials saying the loan would be between 9 and 10 billion euros.\nThe government said the loan would \u201cavert a bankruptcy and prevent a cascade effect on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe money will serve to shore up liquidity and procure replacement gas,\u201d it said in a statement.\nThe government added that Gazprom Germany also would be renamed Securing Energy for Europe GmbH, or SEFE, as a \u201cclear signal to the market that the goal of the measures taken is to ensure the energy supply in Germany and Europe.\u201d\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 The Associated Press.

But the good news is this was much better than Netflix projected, as the streamer previously told shareholders it would likely lose two million subscribers this quarter.\nThe company also said Tuesday it doesn't expect this trend of losses to continue, forecasting a gain of one million subscribers in the third quarter of the year.\nWhen Netflix revealed in April it lost 200,000 subscribers, it was its first quarterly loss in over a decade, prompting existential questions about the future of Netflix and whether the company's business model is sustainable. Though the streamer lost subscribers again, the fact that it beat expectations should allay some of these concerns. The release of Stranger Things' fourth season was likely a major factor in this, as the hit series became the first English-language Netflix show to rack up one billion views.\nNetflix announced plans to crack down on password sharing earlier this year in an effort to increase revenue, and this plan is still in the works. The streamer is now testing a crackdown in certain countries that involves prompting users to pay more to watch Netflix in \"additional homes,\" and on Tuesday, Netflix said it aims to roll out an \"easy-to-use paid sharing offering\" sometime next year.

        "article": "Johnny Depp\u2018s lawyer, Camille Vasquez, has been promoted at her law firm after becoming an overnight sensation during the Depp defamation trial.\nThe case, which concluded last week largely in Depp\u2019s favor, centered around rival defamation lawsuits involving the Pirates of the Caribbean star and his ex-wife, Aquaman actor Amber Heard. The jury ultimately ruled in Depp\u2019s favor for all three of his claims against Heard, accusing her of defaming him for saying he was a domestic abuser. That same jury ruled in favor of Heard for one of her three countersuit claims.\nDepp was initially awarded $15 million, but the damages were capped to $10.4 million due to restrictions in Virginia. Heard, meanwhile, received $2 million. Heard\u2019s sole win was related to Depp\u2019s lawyer, Adam Waldman, claiming in the press that she staged a hoax, which the jury ultimately found defamatory.\nDuring the trial, Depp\u2019s lawyer Vasquez became a subject of adoration for Depp fans, to the point that some people began speculating whether she and Depp were dating. And it wasn\u2019t just pop culture junkies who grew to admire Vasquez, as she apparently got a promotion from her trial skills being put to the test and on full display for the public to see.\nLaw & Crime Network correspondent Angenette Levy reported that Vasquez \u201chas been elevated to partner\u201d thanks to being \u201ca key member of the litigation team that won a jury verdict last week for actor Johnny Depp,\u201d according to her firm, Brown Rudnik.\nAccording to a press release from the law firm\u2019s website, they normally make announcements of this nature at the end of their fiscal year. But due to \u201cCamille\u2019s performance during the Johnny Depp trial,\u201d they took that as proof to the world that she was ready to take the next step.\nVasquez said in part that she was \u201cproud\u201d of the opportunity to join the partnership.\n\u201cI am delighted that Brown Rudnick has given me its full vote of confidence by having me join the partnership. I\u2019m proud of the uniquely talented team I\u2019ve had the privilege to lead, which exemplified teamwork and collaboration, and I look forward to continuing to represent Brown Rudnick\u2019s culture of excellence.\u201d\nVasquez proved an unrelenting force in her cross-examination of Heard on the witness stand, at one point ostensibly giving Heard no other option other than to admit she never fulfilled pledges to charities that she previously claimed in the press to have donated. On the other hand, Depp was also cross-examined just as fiercely by Heard\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Rottenborn, who similarly appeared to catch Depp on the stand downplaying his past drug use.",

        "article": "In the midst of the island nation's unparalleled economic crisis, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has directed officials to have adequate inventories of all vital food items on hand to avoid a shortage. According to the Xinhua news agency, Gotabaya stated that it could prevent organised efforts by some businessmen to raise prices by artificially creating a shortage of goods and acting on people's worries.\nHe believes that a percentage of the agricultural products currently supplied to wholesale should be made available to grocery shops directly. According to the Sri Lankan president, this will lower transportation costs, allowing consumers to buy goods at reduced rates and producers to get higher prices. Rajapaksa also ordered the Consumer Affairs Authority to pursue legal action against individuals who take advantage of the current situation by selling items at inflated costs.\nOn Sunday, Sri Lankan PM Ranil Wickremesinghe announced the formation of five finance committees and 10 monitoring committees to address the country's economic and political problems. Meanwhile, in March and April of this year, Sri Lanka eased import limits on 369 products. Previously, anyone wishing to import any of the 369 items needed to obtain an import license, and the decision to limit imports were made in order to reduce foreign currency spending on foreign products.\nSri Lanka Food Crisis\nFood prices in Sri Lanka have risen rapidly in recent months as a result of poorer yields after the country outlawed the use of artificial fertilisers in April 2021. The government recently relaxed the prohibition on chemical fertiliser and announced that it will import new fertiliser stockpiles for the upcoming planting season. Sri Lanka is in the midst of a historic economic and political catastrophe. For months, large-scale protests have erupted, culminating in the removal of former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the country is also seeking assistance from a South Asian food bank, which has provided rice and other supplies to countries in need. In an interview, Food Commissioner J Krishnamoorthy informed the media outlet that her department had \"just begun the process\" of requesting \"food bank aid\" from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Krishnamoorthy went on to say that Sri Lanka was looking for around 100,000 metric tonnes of food in the form of donations or subsidised sales.\nImage: ANI",

        "article": "SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Two Pasadena men were indicted Wednesday in the case of a hot, airless tractor-trailer rig found last month with 53 dead or dying migrants in San Antonio, officials said.A federal grand jury in San Antonio indicted Homero Zamorano Jr., 46, and Christian Martinez, 28, both of Pasadena, Texas, on counts of transporting and conspiring to transport migrants illegally resulting in death; and transporting and conspiring to transport migrants illegally resulting in serious injury.Both remain in federal custody without bond pending trial. Martinez's attorney, David Shearer of San Antonio, declined to comment on the indictments. A message to Zamorano's attorney was not immediately returned.Conviction on the death counts could result in life sentences, but the Attorney General's Office could authorize prosecutors to seek death penalties. The serious bodily injury counts carry sentences of up to 20 years in prison.It was the deadliest tragedy to claim the lives of migrants smuggled across the border from Mexico. The truck had been packed with 67 people, and the dead included 27 from Mexico, 14 from Honduras, seven from Guatemala and two from El Salvador, said Francisco Gardu\u00f1o, chief of Mexico's National Immigration Institute.The incident happened on a remote San Antonio back road on June 27. Arriving police officers detained Zamorano after spotting him hiding in some nearby brush, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office. A search of Zamorano's cellphone revealed calls with Martinez concerning the smuggling run.Surveillance video of the 18-wheeler passing through a Border Patrol checkpoint showed the driver matched Zamorano's description, according to the indictment. One survivor of the journey, a 20-year-old from Guatemala, told The Associated Press that smugglers had covered the trailer's floor with what she believes was powdered chicken bouillon, apparently to throw off any dogs at the checkpoint.The tragedy occurred at a time when huge numbers of migrants have been coming to the U.S., many of them taking perilous risks to cross swift rivers and canals and scorching desert landscapes. Migrants were stopped nearly 240,000 times in May, up by one-third from a year ago.Of the 73 people in the truck, those who died included people from the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Mexico, Zacatecas, Queretaro, Morelos and Mexico City. Migrants from Honduras and Guatemala also were among those who died in the deadliest known smuggling attempt in the United States.In 2017, 10 people died after being trapped inside a truck parked at a San Antonio Walmart. In 2003, the bodies of 19 migrants were found in a sweltering truck southeast of the city.",

State police identified the suspect as Randal Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, South Carolina.\nHe was taken to a hospital for treatment then released and booked into the Van Buren County jail on multiple charges, including second-degree battery, resisting arrest and making terroristic threats, state police said.\nWorcester\u2019s father declined to comment when contacted Monday by The Associated Press. He referred a reporter to a law firm representing the family. That firm said it was still trying to gather information and did not immediately have a comment on the video.\nWorcester is white, according to jail booking information, and the three officers involved also appear to be white.\nAuthorities have not released the names of the three officers.\n\u201cI hold all my employees accountable for their actions and will take appropriate measures in this matter,\u201d Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said.\nIn a statement released Sunday evening, Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said the community and the department take the matter \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said on Twitter that the incident \u201cwill be investigated pursuant to the video evidence and the request of the prosecuting attorney.\u201d\nCellphone video of often-violent police interactions has put a spotlight on officer conduct in recent years, particularly since the 2020 killing of George Floyd while he was being arrested by police in Minneapolis.\nThe resulting nationwide protests called attention to officer brutality that often targets Black Americans.\nThe front door at building that serves as the Mulberry police headquarters and city hall was locked Monday. A sign on the door directed anyone with questions about \u201cthe police investigation\u201d to contact Arkansas State Police.\nIt was unclear whether the officers were wearing body cameras.\nAmid public pressure for transparency and the proliferation of videos exposing police misconduct, there has been some pushback against recording officers. In July, the governor of Arizona signed a bill that makes it illegal to knowingly record officers from 8 feet or closer without permission.\nMulberry is a town of 1,600 people on the southern edge of the Ozarks in western Arkansas, right off Interstate 40, which runs from California to North Carolina.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz enters the courtroom for a sentencing hearing Tuesday at the Broward County Courthouse.\nImage credit: Amy Beth Bennett\nThe shooter who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 has officially been sentenced to life in prison after an emotional two-day hearing in which family members of the victims confronted him in court.\nIn a Florida courtroom on Wednesday, Nikolas Cruz, now 24, was formally sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for each of 17 charges of first-degree murder. He also received a life sentence for each count of attempted first-degree murder, one for each of the 17 he wounded.\nAs Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer read the sentence \u2014 one for each count, naming each of his victims \u2014 the survivors and family members who had gathered in the courtroom held hands and wept.\n\u201cYou all have been so strong and patient and graceful throughout this process, and I can\u2019t help but think how I would behave or respond if I were in your shoes. The way that you have behaved so gracefully, and showed extraordinary restraint throughout this process, is something that I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Scherer said.\nThe hearing gave families an opportunity to speak directly to Cruz himself, and many chose to do so, expressing their grief and fury over the loss of their loved ones.\nLori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter Alyssa was killed, said she hopes that Cruz is \u201cmiserable for the rest of your pathetic life. My hope for you is that the pain of what you did to my family burns and traumatizes you every day.\u201d\nOn Feb. 14, 2018, Cruz returned to the high school in Parkland, Fla., where he had been a student. Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle, he stalked through hallways of a school building for about six minutes, killing 14 students and three staff members. He escaped from the scene by dropping his gun and running among the fleeing students, authorities later said, and was caught by police about an hour later.\nWith a confession, eyewitnesses and surveillance camera footage, a conviction had been all but assured. Cruz pleaded guilty last October.\nAt his three-month-long trial, which began earlier this year, a Fort Lauderdale jury was tasked with recommending a sentence. They had only two options: life in prison or the death penalty.\nFrom the beginning, his defense team had one goal \u2014 avoiding the death penalty. In the end, they were successful, convincing a jury that his mother\u2019s abuse of alcohol and drugs while she was pregnant with him had left Cruz mentally impaired.\nGrief and fury in the victim impact statements\nThe judge had no power to change Cruz\u2019s sentence, but over a two-day hearing this week, Scherer allowed those affected by the shooting \u2013 both those who survived and family members of those who did not \u2013 to address the gunman and comment on the sentencing.\nFor hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, they expressed their grief and rage. Many denounced the jury\u2019s decision to allow Cruz to avoid the death penalty.\nAnd for the first time, they spoke directly to Cruz, something they had not been allowed to do during the trial.\nThey called him a monster, a sociopath, a \u201cmurdering bastard.\u201d One wished for him to \u201cburn in hell.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea that you, a coldblooded killer, can actually live each day, eat your meals and put your head down at night \u2013 it seems completely unjust,\u201d said Stacey Lippel, a teacher who was wounded in the shooting. \u201cThe only comfort I have is that your life in prison will be filled with horror and fear.\u201d\nOther families directed their anger at Florida\u2019s legal processes and at Cruz\u2019s defense attorneys, including lead attorney Melisa McNeill.\nMax Schachter, whose 14-year old son Alex was killed at the school, said that law was unfair to the victims and their families. And he accused McNeill of falsely claiming that Cruz had not received adequate mental health treatment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for you to make a statement that is an outright lie,\u201d Schachter said. \u201cYou\u2019re making the mental health crisis in America worse by misrepresenting what happened to the Parkland murderer.\u201d\nEventually, some statements grew so heated that McNeill asked the judge to intervene. \u201cI did my job and every member of his team did their job, Judge. And we should not be personally attacked for that,\u201d she said.\nThe judge refused.\nSome have called for Florida to change death sentence rules\nCruz\u2019s sentence of life in prison has renewed calls for Florida\u2019s state legislature to change the state\u2019s rules around death sentences.\nThe state once required a simple majority for a death sentence \u2013 or seven jurors on a panel of 12 \u2013 but after a series of court decisions, in 2016 Florida began requiring unanimous verdicts.\n\u201cWhen you murder in cold blood 17 innocent people, there\u2019s no other punishment that meets the gravity of that crime. And to have one juror holdout on that was a travesty,\u201d said Gov. Ron DeSantis at a recent gubernatorial debate. \u201cSo, yes, I\u2019m going to ask the Florida legislature to amend that statute.\u201d\nIn their statements this week, some Parkland families joined the call for the state legislature to act to allow a majority or supermajority vote for a death sentence.\n\u201cThis would be more fair to the victims,\u201d said Tony Montalto, whose 14-year-old daughter Gina was killed.",

Very sad for him, honestly. He was playing an unbelievable tournament. To see him crying there is a very tough moment. All the best to him,\" said Nadal about his opponent.\n\u201cIt was a very tough match. He was playing amazing and I know how much it means to him to win a Grand Slam.\n\u201cThe conditions were not ideal for me. I had to do a lot of surviving. The first set was a miracle but I was fighting,\u201d he added.\nEarlier, Zverev went toe-to-toe with Nadal, who has won the claycourt major a record 13-times. Zverev, playing in the semi-finals at Roland Garros for the second successive year, hit 25 winners and 26 unforced errors in his all-or-nothing approach against the Spaniard.\nNadal came out on top in the first-set tie-break after 91 minutes but it was Zverev who raced to a 5-3 lead in the second one. He, however, made three double faults in the very next game. Nadal broke him and eventually drew level.\nNadal now sets sights on becoming the oldest champion at the tournament. He is set to take on first-time Grand Slam finalist Casper Ruud, who defeated Croatia's Marin Cilic 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in the second semi-final.\nNadal will be playing his 30th Grand Slam final and he has a chance to claim a record-extending 22nd major title.\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",

        "article": "As if a million merger arbs suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.\nJust before 2pm ET, the US Federal Trade Commission confirmed earlier rumors when it announced that it had voted 3-1 to sue to block Microsoft\u2019s $69 billion acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard, saying the tie-up between the Xbox maker and popular gaming publisher would harm competition in the gaming market.\nThe commission voted to proceed with the complaint, which will be filed in its in-house court Thursday, in a closed-door meeting, said two BBG sources.\nThe full statement is below:\nFTC Seeks to Block Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. Agency alleges that maker of Xbox would gain control of top video game franchises, enabling it to harm competition in high-performance gaming consoles and subscription services by denying or degrading rivals\u2019 access to its popular content The Federal Trade Commission is seeking to block technology giant Microsoft Corp. from acquiring leading video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its blockbuster gaming franchises such as Call of Duty, alleging that the $69 billion deal, Microsoft\u2019s largest ever and the largest ever in the video gaming industry, would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business. In a complaint issued today, the FTC pointed to Microsoft\u2019s record of acquiring and using valuable gaming content to suppress competition from rival consoles, including its acquisition of ZeniMax, parent company of Bethesda Softworks. Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda's titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival consoles. \u201cMicrosoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,\u201d said Holly Vedova, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition. \u201cToday we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series S and Series X are one of only two types of high performance video game consoles. Importantly, Microsoft also offers a leading video game content subscription service called Xbox Game Pass, as well as a cutting-edge cloud-based video game streaming service, according to the complaint. Activision is one of only a very small number of top video game developers in the world that create and publish high-quality video games for multiple devices, including video game consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. It produces some of the most iconic and popular video game titles, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch, and has a combined 154 million monthly active users around the world, according to the FTC\u2019s complaint. Activision currently has a strategy of offering its games on many devices regardless of producer. But that could change if the deal is allowed to proceed. With control over Activision\u2019s blockbuster franchises, Microsoft would have both the means and motive to harm competition by manipulating Activision\u2019s pricing, degrading Activision\u2019s game quality or player experience on rival consoles and gaming services, changing the terms and timing of access to Activision\u2019s content, or withholding content from competitors entirely, resulting in harm to consumers. The Commission vote to issue the complaint was 3-1, with Commissioner Christine S. Wilson voting no. A copy of the administrative complaint will be available shortly.\nHaving limped lower in recent weeks below where it had been trading around $80, already a wide discount to the $95 MSFT purchase price, ATVI stock slumped 2.5% to $74...\n... while MSFT stock dropped about $2 from session highs some 2% higher on the session, to trade up just 0.9%.\nThe drop in MSFT promptly hammered the Nasdaq and sent shockwaves across the entire market, pushing spoos down more than 25 points to near session lows around 3950 having traded at session highs of 3975 just moments earlier.",

Indy rewarded Leonard with a five-year, $98.5 million contract extension last summer, which made him the highest-paid linebacker at the time.\n\u201cReally I don\u2019t know the exact timetable yet,\u201d Reich said. \u201cIn my mind, just as long as he\u2019s ready to play the regular season. Does he need to play preseason? Sure, it would be nice if he played but if it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m not worried about it.\u201d\nReich said Jonathan Taylor, last season\u2019s NFL rushing champion, also sat out Tuesday for precautionary reasons.\n___\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "article": "A court in military-ruled Myanmar convicted the country's ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi of corruption Friday, sentencing her to seven years in prison in the last of a string of criminal cases against her, a legal official said. The court's action leaves her with a total of 33 years to serve in prison after a series of politically tinged prosecutions since the army toppled her elected government in February 2021, per the AP. The case that ended Friday involved five offenses under the anti-corruption law. The 77-year-old Suu Kyi has also been convicted of several other offenses, including illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies, violating coronavirus restrictions, breaching the country's official secrets act, sedition, and election fraud.\nHer previous convictions had landed her with a total of 26 years behind bars. Suu Kyi's supporters and independent analysts say the numerous charges against her and her allies are an attempt to legitimize the military's seizure of power while eliminating her from politics before an election it has promised for 2023. In the five counts of corruption decided Friday, Suu Kyi was alleged to have abused her position and caused a loss of state funds by neglecting to follow financial regulations in granting permission to Win Myat Aye, a Cabinet member in her former government, to hire, buy, and maintain a helicopter.\nSuu Kyi was the de facto head of government, holding the title of state counselor. Win Myint, who was president in her government, was a co-defendant in the same case and received the same sentence. Friday's verdict in the purpose-built courtroom in the main prison on the outskirts of the capital, Naypyitaw, was made known by a legal official who insisted on anonymity for fear of being punished by the authorities. The trial was closed to the media, diplomats, and spectators, and her lawyers were barred by a gag order from talking about it.\n\"From start to finish, the junta grabbed whatever it could to manufacture cases against her with full confidence that the country's kangaroo courts would come back with whatever punitive judgments the military wanted,\" Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said in an emailed statement. Her lawyers are expected to appeal. The anonymous official also said both Suu Kyi and Win Myint appeared to be in good health.",

Estonian broadcaster ERR said the dismantling was underway.\nPhotos posted on the ERR web site showed Estonian military and heavy machinery moving the monument after flowers and candles had been removed from the site.\nThe common grave of the victims of World War II in Narva will get a neutral grave marker and it will remain a dignified site for commemorating them, Kallas said.\nForeign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said in a government statement that Russia \"wanted to use the memorials commemorating the criminal occupation regime to fuel tensions in Estonian society.\"\nOn Aug. 15, the town council in Narva decided the monument should be removed and shortly after a crowd gathered around the monument to protest the plan.\nConsidering the current situation, ensuring public order is complicated for the authorities of the city of Narva,\" Laanemets said in the same statement, and called it a \"a great and complex issue.\"\nA total of seven Soviet-era monuments in Narva also would be removed, the government said Tuesday.\nSince winning independence in 1991, the former Soviet republic of 1.3 million people has been entangled in disputes over the status of Russians, most of whom came to Estonia during the 50 years of Soviet rule.\nIn 2007, the relocation of the so-called Bronze Statue of Tallinn, another Soviet war memorial, from a city park led to days of rioting. One person died and more than 1,000 arrests were made, with Russian-speaking Estonians claiming the removal of the memorial erased their history. The statue was later moved to a military cemetery.\n___\nFollow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "article": "PHOENIX \u2014 A judge on Saturday denied an Arizona prisoner\u2019s bid to delay his execution in the 1984 killing of an 8-year-old girl.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Liburdi keeps on track Wednesday\u2019s scheduled execution of Frank Atwood, who argued the state\u2019s death penalty procedures would violate his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting him to unimaginable pain.\nHis lawyers said Atwood, who has a degenerative spinal condition that has left him in a wheelchair would undergo excruciating suffering if he were strapped to a gurney while lying on his back during his lethal injection execution.\nLiburdi said he would not block the execution based on Atwood\u2019s claim, noting that the state will provide Atwood with a medical wedge that will relieve pressure on his spine and can also tilt the execution table. He said those accommodations \u201cwill minimize the pain Plaintiff experiences when he lies on his back.\u201d\nThe constitution, Liburdi wrote, \u201cdoes not require a pain-free execution,\u201d and that his position will be similar to what he typically assumes in his cell to limit pain.\nLiburdi also rejected challenges to the drug the state plans to use.\nAtwood\u2019s attorneys have already appealed the judge\u2019s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nAtwood was convicted of murder in the 1984 killing of Vicki Hoskinson.\nAuthorities have said Atwood kidnapped Hoskinson, whose remains were discovered in the desert northwest of Tucson nearly seven months after her disappearance. Experts could not determine the cause of death from the remains that were found, according to court records.\nAtwood maintains that he is innocent of the crimes.\nUntil last month, Arizona went almost eight years without carrying out an execution. The hiatus has been attributed to the difficulty of securing lethal injection drugs as manufacturers refuse to supply them and to problems encountered during the July 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, who was given 15 doses of a two-drug combination over nearly two hours. Wood snorted repeatedly and gasped before he died. His attorney said the execution had been botched.\nThe hiatus ended on May 11 when the state executed prisoner Clarence Dixon for his murder conviction in the 1978 killing of Deana Bowdoin, a 21-year-old Arizona State University student.\nAs part of Atwood\u2019s argument to get his execution delayed, his lawyers questioned whether the compounded pentobarbital to be used in the execution meets pharmaceutical standards and whether the state has met a requirement that the drug\u2019s expiration date falls after the execution date. They also challenged Arizona\u2019s protocol for gas chamber executions.\nProsecutors say Atwood was trying to indefinitely postpone his execution through legal maneuvers.\nTwo weeks ago, Atwood declined to choose between lethal injection or the gas chamber, leaving him to be put to death by lethal injection, the state\u2019s default execution method.\nEven though he didn\u2019t pick the gas chamber, he still challenged the state\u2019s lethal gas protocol that calls for the use of hydrogen cyanide gas, which was used in some past U.S. executions and by Nazis to kill 865,000 Jews at the Auschwitz concentration camp alone. His lawyers say hydrogen cyanide gas is unconstitutional and produces agonizing levels of pain in executions.\nWithout explicitly saying Atwood wants to die by the gas chamber, his lawyers argue he has a right to choose between methods of execution that are constitutional and said state should switch its lethal gas from hydrogen cyanide gas to nitrogen gas because nitrogen would produce painless deaths.\nArizona, California, Missouri and Wyoming are the only states with decades-old lethal-gas execution laws still on the books. Arizona, which carried out the last gas chamber execution in the United States more than two decades ago, is the only state to still have a working gas chamber.\nIn recent years, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Alabama have passed laws allowing executions with nitrogen gas, at least in some circumstances, though experts say it\u2019s never been done and no state has established a protocol that would allow it.\nAtwood\u2019s lawyers also said Arizona could take up executions by firing squad \u2014 a method of execution not used in the state.\nProsecutors say Atwood\u2019s challenge of execution protocols is not aimed at minimizing the pain he will feel when he is put to death, but rather to delay the execution indefinitely by requesting alternative methods of execution that he knows the state is unable to provide without significant changes to its execution protocol and the state constitution.\nBy JACQUES BILLEAUD\nAssociated Press",

It will be a good time to see the progress of reigning Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes.

I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process,\" he added.\nSharron Davies, an ex-Great Britain swimmer who has continually argued against transgender participation in women's swimming, tweeted that she was \"proud\" of Fina and her sport for \"doing the science, asking the athletes/coaches and standing up for fair sport for females\".\n\"Swimming will always welcome everyone no matter how you identify but fairness is the cornerstone of sport,\" she stressed.\nBut LGBT advocacy group 'Athlete Ally' branded the new policy \"discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles\".\n\"If we truly want to protect women's sports, we must include all women,\" said a tweet from the group, which has backed former UPenn college swimmer Lia Thomas in the past.\nFina's new policy comes at a time when transgender participation in women's competitions is one of the most debated topics in sport and has only intensified with Thomas' success.\nIn March, Thomas, who swam on the UPenn men's team before undergoing hormone replacement treatment in 2019, won the highest national college title in the US when taking part in the women's 500-yard freestyle, and she also broke several records at her former Ivy League college.\nIn cycling, there has also been a furor over British cyclist Emily Bridges being allowed to take part in elite women's events or not.\nMoves from Fina's counterpart in the sport the UCI this week mean that she will have to wait until 2023 for this given that the body has doubled the period of time before a rider who has transitioned from male to female can take part in women's events to two years.",

China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang, claims China have denied.\nBut a report published on Wednesday, August 31 in the wake of the visit by UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet in May, said that \u201callegations of patterns of torture, or ill-treatment, including forced medical treatment and adverse conditions of detention, are credible, as are allegations of individual incidents of sexual and gender-based violence.\u201d\nIn a strongly-worded assessment at the end of the report released Wednesday,, OHCHR said that the extent of arbitrary detentions against Uyghur and others, in context of \u201crestrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights, enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.\u201d\nThe UN rights office said that Wednesday\u2019s report was \u201cbased on a rigorous review of documentary material currently available to the Office, with its credibility assessed in accordance with standard human rights methodology.\n\u201cParticular attention was given to the Government\u2019s own laws, policies, data and statements. The Office also requested information and engaged in dialogue and technical exchanges with China throughout the process.\u201d\nThe report was published on Ms. Bachelet\u2019s final day of her four-year term in office.\nIt says that the violations have taken place in the context of the Chinese Government\u2019s assertion that it is targeting terrorists among the Uyghur minority with a counter-extremism strategy that involves the use of so-called Vocational Educational and Training Centres, or re-education camps.\nOHCHR said that the Government policy in recent years in Xinjiang has \u201cled to interlocking patterns of severe and undue restrictions on a wide range of human rights.\u201d\nEven if the VETC system has as China says, \u201cbeen reduced in scope or wound up\u201d, said OHCHR, \u201cthe laws and policies that underpin it remain in place\u201d, leading to an increased use of imprisonment.\nThe systems of arbitrary detention and related patterns of abuse since 2017, said OHCHR, \u201ccome against the backdrop of broader discrimination\u201d against Uyghur and other minorities.\n\u201cThis has included far-reaching, arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions on human rights and fundamental freedoms, in violation of international laws and standards\u201d, including restrictions on religious freedom and the rights to privacy and movement.\nFurthermore, the report said that Chinese Government policies in the region have \u201ctranscended borders\u201d, separating families, \u201csevering\u201d contacts, producing \u201cpatterns of intimidations and threats\u201d against the wider Uyghur diaspora who have spoken out about conditions at home.\nOHCHR said that the Chinese Government \u201cholds the primary duty to ensure that all laws and policies are brought into compliance with international human rights law and to promptly investigate any allegations of human rights violations, to ensure accountability for perpetrators, and to provide redress to victims.\u201d\nIn a long and detailed response to the report, the Chinese Government said in conclusion, that authorities in the Xinjiang region operate on the principle that everyone is equal before the law, \u201cand the accusation that its policy is \u2018based on discrimination\u2019 is groundless.\u201d\nChina said that its counter-terrorism and \u201cde-radicalization efforts\u201d in the region, had been conducted according to \u201cthe rule of law\u201d and by no means add up to \u201csuppression of ethnic minorities.\u201d\nOn the issue of the camps, Beijing responded that the VETCs are \u201clearning facilities established in accordance with law intended for de-radicalization\u201d and not \u201cconcentration camps\u201d.\n\u201cThe lawful rights and interests of workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are protected and there is no such thing as \u2018forced labour\u2019\u201d, China\u2019s statement said, adding that there had been no \u201cmassive violation of rights\u201d.\nThe statement calls on the international community to be \u201cclear-eyed about the truth\u201d of its counter-terrorism campaign in the region, and \u201csee through the clumsy performances and malicious motives of anti-China forces in the US and the West, who attempt to use Xinjiang to contain China.\u201d\nThe Chines government said instead, the UN and other international organizations, should investigate \u201cthe human rights disasters caused, and numerous crimes committed, by the US and some other Western countries, both at home and abroad.\u201d",

Among the dead was an off-duty Raleigh police officer, Gabriel Torres, who was on his way to work when the shooting began. A second police officer was wounded and released from the hospital, while a 59-year-old woman is hospitalized in critical condition.\nThe suspect, who was not immediately identified by police, eluded officers for hours before he was cornered in a home and arrested, police said.\nThe shooting set off a massive police response and manhunt, with police scouring an area of more than 2 miles to find and capture the suspect, Patterson said. She said authorities have not yet determined any motive for the shooting. Officials have not said how the suspect was injured.\nGov. Roy Cooper called the shooting an \u201cinfuriating and tragic act of gun violence.\u201d\n\u201cToday we\u2019re sad, we\u2019re angry and we want to know the answers to all the questions,\u201d Cooper said.\n\u201cI think we all know the core truth \u2014 no neighborhood, no parent, no child, no grandparent, no one should feel this fear in their communities \u2014 no one.\u201d\nThe gunfire broke out around 5 p.m. in a residential area northeast of downtown, Raleigh Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin said. Officers from numerous law enforcement agencies swarmed the area, closing roads and warning residents to stay inside while they searched for the shooter.\nThe Neuse River Greenway runs just behind the backs of houses in the Hedingham neighborhood where the shooting began. The trail runs about 27 miles along the river and connects to the state\u2019s Mountains-to-Sea Trail that\u2019s popular with thru-hikers. The stretch behind the neighborhood is paved and lies down a grassy slope from the houses.\nThe Raleigh shooting was the latest in a violent week across the country. Five people were killed Sunday in a shooting at a home in Inman, South Carolina. On Wednesday night two police officers were fatally shot in Connecticut after apparently being drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence. Police officers have been shot this week in Greenville, Mississippi; Decatur, Illinois; Philadelphia, Las Vegas and central Florida. Two of those officers, one in Greenville and one Las Vegas, were killed.\nThursday\u2019s violence was the 25th mass killing in 2022 in which the victims were fatally shot, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings database. A mass killing is defined as when four or more people are killed excluding the perpetrator.\nBrooke Medina, who lives in the neighborhood bordering the greenway, was driving home at around 5:15 p.m. when she saw about two dozen police cars, both marked and unmarked, race toward the residential area about 9 miles from Raleigh\u2019s downtown. She then saw ambulances speeding the other direction, toward the closest hospital.\nShe and her husband, who was working from home with their four children, started reaching out to neighbors and realized there was a shelter-in-place order.\nThe family closed all of their window blinds, locked the doors and congregated in an upstairs hallway together, said Medina, who works as a communications vice president at a think tank. The family listened to the police scanner and watched local news before going back downstairs once the danger seemed to have moved farther away from their home.\nShe described the neighborhood known as Hedingham as a sprawling, dense, tree-lined community that\u2019s full of single-family homes, duplexes and townhomes that are more moderately priced compared to other parts of the Raleigh area.\n___\nDazio reported from Los Angeles.

It\u2019s the largest fine ever leveled against a bank by the CFPB and the largest yet against Wells Fargo, which has spent years trying to rehabilitate its image after a series of scandals tied to its sales practices.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Consumer banking giant Wells Fargo agreed to pay $3.7 billion to settle charges that it harmed customers by charging illegal fees and interest on auto loans and mortgages, as well as incorrectly applying overdraft fees against savings and checking accounts.\nAdvertisement\nRegulators made it clear, however, that they believe Wells Fargo has further to go on that front.\n\u201cPut simply: Wells Fargo is a corporate recidivist that puts one out of three Americans at risk for potential harm,\u201d said CFPB director Rohit Chopra, in a call with reporters.\nThe bank\u2019s pattern of behavior has made it necessary for regulators to take additional actions against Wells Fargo that go beyond the $3.7 billion in fines and penalties, Chopra said.\nThe violations impacted more than 16 million customers, the bureau said. In addition to improperly charging auto loan customers with fees and interest, the bank wrongfully repossessed vehicles in some cases. The bank also improperly denied thousands of mortgage loan modifications for homeowners.\nWells Fargo has been sanctioned repeatedly by US regulators for violations of consumer protection laws going back to 2016, when employees were found to have opened millions of accounts illegally in order to meet unrealistic sales goals. Since then, executives have repeatedly said Wells Fargo is cleaning up its act, only for the bank to be found in violation of other parts of consumer protection law, including in its auto and mortgage lending businesses.\nAdvertisement\nWells Fargo paid a $1 billion penalty in 2018 for widespread consumer law violations, the largest against a bank for such violations at the time.\nThe bank had signaled to its investors that it anticipated additional fines and penalties from regulators and aside $2 billion in the third quarter for that reason.\nWells Fargo remains under a Federal Reserve order forbidding the bank from growing any larger until the Fed deems that its problems are resolved. That order, originally enacted in 2018, was expected to last only a year or two.\nChief executive Charles Scharf said in a prepared statement Tuesday that the agreement with the CFPB is part of an effort to \u201ctransform operating practices at Wells Fargo and to put these issues behind us.\u201d\nWhile Wells Fargo tried to frame the agreement with the CFPB as a resolution of established bad behavior, CFPB officials said some of the violations cited in Tuesday\u2019s order took place this year.\n\u201cThis should not been seen as Wells Fargo has moved past its problems,\u201d Chopra said.",

        "article": "Advertisement\nThe nephew of Formula One legend Michael Schumacher has broken his spine in a horror crash in Germany. David Schumacher, 20, suffered the injuries after a collision with Thomas Preining during Saturday's DTM event at Hockenheimring.\nBoth cars were battling for position following a safety car restart when they made contact braking into turn eight, sending them careering into the barriers before bouncing back onto the circuit. The ensuing chaos caused the SSR Porsche of Dennis Olsen to lose control and engine components that flew loose from his car briefly ignited into a fireball on the track. Schumacher's Winward Mercedes and several other vehicles sustained heavy damage and the race was red-flagged.\nAll the drivers involved were taken for medical checks and Schumacher, 20, who is the son of ex-Formula One driver Ralf, was initially given the all-clear. However, further examinations later in the week revealed a lumbar vertebra in his back was broken.\nRalf Schumacher told Motorsport magazine: 'When David came home, he was still complaining about back pain. 'We then decided to go to a hospital in Salzburg to have a MRI done. It turned out that a lumbar vertebra was broken.' Pictured: Onboard footage from Preining's car showed the moment Schumacher went off before him.\n'According to the treating physicians, this means a break of around six weeks for David.' The DTM series finished at the weekend, meaning Schumacher won't miss any racing during his six-week rehabilitation and he doesn't require surgery.\nPreining blamed Schumacher for the crash but Schumacher's mom Cora hit back on social media. She wrote: 'David Schumacher is doing well, that's the most important thing. Nevertheless, I have to say that I absolutely don't think it's okay for Thomas Preining to make negative comments about our son every time without any self-reflection.' Pictured: A fireball exploded on the track from engine parts thrown from Olsen's car as cars collided and careered off in all directions, leading to the race being red-flagged.\nCora continues: 'He himself had oversteered and did not have his car under control. It's always easier to look for faults in others.' Pictured: Marshalls remove debris from the race track following the multi-car collision on Saturday.\nDavid's uncle Michael, the seven-time Formula One world champion, has been out of the public gaze since he suffered a severe brain injury during a skiing accident in the French Alps back in December 2013. Michael Schumacher was placed in a medically-included coma in 2014 and taken to his family home in Switzerland. In 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt said Schumacher was 'making good progress' but 'struggles to communicate.' Todt said the former racer could watch F1 on television at home. Updates on his health remain few and far between, however.\nThe future of Mick Schumacher, who is David's cousin and Michael's son, is up in the air with Haas yet to renew his contract, which expires at the end of the current F1 season. He crashed out during the first practice session of the Japanese Grand Prix last weekend and then finished 17th in the race.

His arrest comes nearly two years after the DOJ revealed that it had charged him in connection with the explosion.\nTwo other Libyan intelligence officials have been charged in the U.S. for their alleged involvement in the attack, but Mas'ud is the first defendant to appear in an American courtroom for prosecution.\nThe New York-bound Pan Am flight exploded over Lockerbie less than an hour after takeoff from London on Dec. 21, 1988. Citizens from 21 countries were killed. Among the 190 Americans on board were 35 Syracuse University students flying home for Christmas after a semester abroad.\nPIERS MORGAN CALLS OUT LACK OF CONVICTIONS IN LOCKERBIE BOMBING ATTACK: \u2018COMPLETE DISGRACE\u2019\n\"Although nearly 34 years have passed since the defendant's actions, countless families have never fully recovered,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Erik Kenerson said during a court proceeding attended by victims' relatives.\nThe bearded and balding Mas'ud wore a green jail uniform, and walked with a halting gait to the defense table. He spoke occasionally through an interpreter, and the federal defenders who represented him at the hearing said he wanted to be represented by his own lawyers.\nAt one point, as the charges were being discussed, Mas'ud said in Arabic, \"I cannot talk until I see my attorney.\"\nA detention hearing was set for later in the month.\nThe bombing laid bare the threat of international terrorism more than a decade before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It produced global investigations and punishing sanctions while spurring demands for accountability from victims of those killed.\nThe Libyan government initially balked at turning over the two men, Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, before ultimately surrendering them for prosecution before a panel of Scottish judges sitting in the Netherlands as part of a special arrangement.\nThe DOJ, which did not disclose how Mas'ud came to be taken into U.S. custody, has said Mas'ud faces two criminal counts related to the explosion.\nA breakthrough in the investigation came when U.S. officials in 2017 received a copy of an interview that Mas'ud, a longtime explosives expert for Libya's intelligence service, had given to Libyan law enforcement in 2012 after being taken into custody following the collapse of the government of the country's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.\nIn that interview, U.S. officials said, Mas'ud admitted building the bomb in the Pan Am attack and working with two other conspirators to carry out the attack. He also said the operation was ordered by Libyan intelligence and that Gadhafi thanked him and other team members after the attack, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case.\nThat affidavit said Mas'ud told Libyan law enforcement that he flew to Malta to meet al-Megrahi and Fhimah. He handed Fhimah a medium-sized Samsonite suitcase containing a bomb, having already been instructed to set the timer so that the device would explode exactly 11 hours later, according to the document. He then flew to Tripoli, the FBI said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAl-Megrahi was convicted in the Netherlands, while Fhimah was acquitted of all charges. Al-Megrahi was given a life sentence, but Scottish authorities released him on humanitarian grounds in 2009 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Its last and most powerful one in 2017 -- which Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb -- had an estimated yield of 250 kilotons.\nWashington is Seoul's key security ally and stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from the North.\nThe two countries have long carried out joint exercises, which they insist are purely defensive but North Korea sees them as rehearsals for an invasion.\nLast month, the United States and South Korea staged their biggest combined military drills since 2018 -- the resumption of large-scale training sessions that had been scaled back due to Covid-19 and the bout of failed diplomacy with Pyongyang.\nPAY ATTENTION: Click \u201cSee First\u201d under the \u201cFollowing\u201d tab to see TUKO News on your News Feed\nSource: AFP",

Less than a year ago, Cosby\u2019s sexual assault conviction was thrown out.\nHuth\u2019s suit alleged that Cosby brought her and another underage friend to the mansion, lured her to a bedroom and forced himself on her.\nPer the BBC, Huth told the court she felt \u201cmad, duped and foolish\u201d after the incident, as her lawyers presented a photo of her and Cosby inside the mansion.\nCosby didn\u2019t appear at the trial, but a 2015 deposition was played, in which the comedian said he did not remember her and would not have pursued sex with a minor.\nLawyers for Cosby, per reports, claimed Huth offered her photo with Cosby to tabloids for money.\nPer The Associated Press:\nCosby\u2019s attorneys agreed that Cosby met Huth and her high school friend on a Southern California film set in April of 1975, then took them to the Playboy Mansion a few days later.\nHuth\u2019s friend Donna Samuelson, a key witness, took photos at the mansion of Huth and Cosby, which loomed large at the trial.\nHuth testified that in a bedroom adjacent to a game room where the three had been hanging out, Cosby attempted to put his hand down her pants, then exposed himself and forced her to perform a sex act.\nIn 2018, Cosby was convicted of drugging and molesting a woman at his home in 2004 and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. The conviction, however, was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last year. He was released from prison after serving nearly three years.",

They did leave the campground to get medical attention.\nBiologists tracked down and captured the bear, a 350-pound male. The bear was euthanized Monday because of concerns that it might again threaten humans.\nThe Park Service says the incident occurred at about 5:20 a.m. Sunday at the Elkmonth Campground. The family of five and their dog were sleeping in their tent when the bear ripped into the tent and got inside. The father needed several attempts to scare the bear off, officials say.\nThe campsite was closed early Sunday morning when rangers responded to the site. Traps were set for the bear at the campsite and it soon returned.\n\u201cThe bear exhibited extreme food-conditioned behavior and lack of fear of humans, boldly entering the trap without wariness,\u201d the news release says. The Park Service says the bear\u2019s behavior \u201cappeared to be inconsistent with predatory behavior, but rather that of a food-conditioned bear.\u201d Bears can be attracted to campgrounds and picnic areas by the smell of food and garbage.\n\u201cThe bear weighed approximately 350 pounds, which is not standard for this time of year, suggesting the bear had previous and likely consistent access to non-natural food sources,\u201d said Lisa McInnis, chief of resource management. \u201cIn this incident, the bear was likely attracted to food smells throughout the area, including dog food at the involved campsite. It is very difficult to deter this learned behavior and, as in this case, the result can lead to an unacceptable risk to people.\u201d\nThe Park Service says human-bear conflicts peak in late May and June when natural foods, like berries, are not yet available.",

We the people cannot WAIT to water the trees of liberty with your blood. I\u2019ll be waiting for you to kick down my door,\u201d Bies wrote in another post, according to court documents.\nIf convicted, Bies faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.\nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security reportedly warned of an increase in federal law enforcement threats in a joint bulletin last week.\nThe bulletin referenced calls for \u201ccivil war\u201d and \u201carmed rebellion\u201d as well as an incident at the FBI\u2019s Cincinnati field office on Thursday in which an armed man attempted to breach the building. He was ultimately shot and killed by police.\nOfficials erected barriers along the perimeter of the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., after calls for protests there.\nThe increase in threats has led Democrats and some Republicans to call for Trump, who has repeatedly lambasted the FBI and DOJ\u2019s search and accused them of political bias, to tone down his rhetoric.\nTrump told Fox News on Monday that his team had reached out to DOJ to offer \u201cwhatever we can do to help,\u201d saying the \u201ctemperature has to be brought down,\u201d but he has continued attacking the agencies since the interview.\nThe FBI\u2019s arrest on Friday comes after it seized 11 sets of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago in connection with its investigation into whether Trump violated the Espionage Act, unlawfully concealed or removed public records or obstructed an investigation.\nTrump has said he declassified the documents.",

Read full story\nThe ECOWAS bloc did not immediately comment on the 24-month decree adopted on Monday.\nThe length of the transition has also caused a rift with Mali's partners including the United States and former colonial power, France.\nMaiga said both the ECOWAS mediator on the crisis, former Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan, and heads of state had been informed of the 24-month decree.\n\"We are hopeful... the sanctions will be lifted imminently,\" he said, adding that an electoral timeline would follow.\nWest African heads of state met in Ghana's capital Accra over the weekend to discuss the situation and agreed not to lift sanctions, which include border closures and restrictions on financial transactions, unless interim leaders proposed a shorter transition.\nThe leaders are expected to convene for another summit before July 3.\nMilitary governments in neighboring Burkina Faso and Guinea are also facing similar threats from ECOWAS for dragging their feet on democratic transitions.",

It follows a British court ruling in April that Assange could be sent to the U.S.\nLONDON \u2014 The British government has ordered the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States to face spying charges. He is likely to appeal.\n\u201cNor have they found that extradition would be incompatible with his human rights, including his right to a fair trial and to freedom of expression, and that whilst in the U.S. he will be treated appropriately, including in relation to his health.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe decision is a big moment in Assange\u2019s years-long battle to avoid facing trial in the U.S. \u2014 though not necessarily the end of the tale. Assange has 14 days to appeal.\nA British judge approved the extradition in April, leaving the final decision to the government. The ruling came after a legal battle that went all the way to the U.K. Supreme Court.\nThe U.S. has asked British authorities to extradite Assange so he can stand trial on 17 charges of espionage and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of a huge trove of classified documents more than a decade ago. American prosecutors say Assange unlawfully helped U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal classified diplomatic cables and military files that WikiLeaks later published, putting lives at risk.\nJournalism organizations and human rights groups have called on Britain to refuse the extradition request.\nSupporters and lawyers for Assange, 50, argue that he was acting as a journalist and is entitled to First Amendment protections of freedom of speech for publishing documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. They argue that his case is politically motivated.\nAdvertisement\nAssange\u2019s lawyers say he could face up to 175 years in jail if he is convicted in the U.S., though American authorities have said any sentence is likely to be much lower than that.\nAssange has been held at Britain\u2019s high-security Belmarsh Prison in London since 2019, when he was arrested for skipping bail during a separate legal battle. Before that, he spent seven years inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault.\nSweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed.",

The decision was taken at the GMC board meeting, which is probably the last before the announcement of the municipal polls in Uttar Pradesh\nThe current guidelines of the GMC mandate the registration of pet dogs as well as compulsory training for these three breeds. However, in the wake of the recent dog attacks, the GMC board on Saturday passed the resolution to not allow the registration of three breeds of dogs, said an official of the corporation.\nThe official further said that the corporation will cease the registration of these three breeds of dogs after two months. However, those residents who already own these dogs are required to register and sterilise their pets within this period.\nNitin Gaur, commissioner of GMC said that anyone found keeping these three breeds of dogs without registration will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5000 per instance. \u201cThe decision was taken by the corporation board after due consideration,\u201d he added as quoted by The Hindustan Times.\nDr. Anuj Singh, veterinary and social welfare officer, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation said, as reported by The Hindustan Times, \u201cGMC has bylaws for the registration of pet dogs in the city and the new resolution will now become a part of existing bylaws. These three breeds of dogs will not be registered after two months and their owners will be liable for a heavy penalty if they keep unregistered dogs. The decision was taken after councilors agreed that the three breeds of dogs are aggressive and involved in several dog attacks.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the board meeting of the GMC ended on a stormy note with councilors cutting across party lines rushing to the mayor's dais, and raising slogans against officials concerned. They alleged that GMC's wrong policies led the corporation into a dire financial crisis.\nPrior to Ghaziabad, the Kanpur Municipal Corporation House passed a resolution to ban rearing of the Pitbull and Rottweiler dog breeds in the city in September. The resolution said anyone found rearing either of the two breeds will be fined up to Rs 5,000 and their 'pet' will be confiscated.\nThe resolution was later sent to the municipal commissioner to issue a formal order in this regard.",

The leak happened in the same place that saw seepage during a dress rehearsal back in the spring.\nStay informed about local news and weather. Get the NBC 4 New York app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts.\nThen, NASA ran into new trouble when it was unable to properly chill one of the rocket's four main engines, officials said. Engineers continued working to pinpoint the source of the problem after the launch postponement was announced.\n\u201cThis is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work, and you don\u2019t want to light the candle until it\u2019s ready to go,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.\nReferring to launch delays, Nelson said: \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the space business and it\u2019s part of, particularly, a test flight.\u201d\nThe rocket was set to lift off on a flight to propel a crew capsule into orbit around the moon. The six-week mission was scheduled to end with the capsule returning to Earth in a splashdown in the Pacific in October.\nThe 322-foot spaceship is the most powerful rocket ever built by NASA, out-muscling even the Saturn V that the Apollo astronauts rode.\nAs for when NASA might make another liftoff attempt, launch commentator Derrol Nail said engineers were still analyzing the engine problem and \u201cwe must wait to see what shakes out from their test data.\u201d\nNo astronauts were inside the rocket's Orion capsule. Instead, the test dummies, fitted with sensors to measure vibration, cosmic radiation and other conditions, were strapped in for the shakedown flight, meant to stress-test the spacecraft and push it to its limits in ways that would never be attempted with humans aboard.\nEven though no one was on board, thousands of people jammed the coast to see the rocket soar. Vice President Kamala Harris was among the VIPs who arrived for the event.\nNASA\u2019s Artemis 1 moon mission is set to blast off on Monday with new megarocket technology and galactic ambitions. The goal is to start creating a sustainable way station at the moon that will allow us to explore Mars and go deeper into space.\nAssuming the shakedown flight goes well, astronauts will strap in for the second mission and fly around the moon and back as soon as 2024. A two-person lunar landing could follow by the end of 2025.\nThe problems seen Monday were reminiscent of NASA's space shuttle era, when hydrogen fuel leaks disrupted countdowns and delayed a string of launches back in 1990.\nLater in the morning, NASA also officials spotted what they feared was a crack or some other defect on the core stage \u2014 the big orange fuel tank with four main engines on it \u2014 but they later said it appeared to be just a buildup of frost in a crevice of the insulating foam.\nLaunch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson and her team also had to deal with a communication problem involving the Orion capsule.\nEngineers scrambled to understand an 11-minute delay in the communication lines between launch control and Orion that cropped up late Sunday. Though the problem had cleared by Monday morning, NASA needed to know why it happened before committing to a launch.\nRegardless of all the technical snags, thunderstorms ultimately would have prevented a liftoff. Dark clouds gathered over the launch site as soon as Blackwell-Thompson halted the countdown, with thunder echoing across the coast.",

The news was then also picked up by other British media, according to which the generous donor was Bakr bin Laden, patriarch of the wealthy Saudi family, together with his brother Shafiq, both half brothers of Osama.\nAccording to the Sunday of Times, Carlo had a meeting with Bakr, now 76, at his London residence, Clarence House.

Spina Jr., 25, of Roseland was sentenced by a judge in Southern California's Orange County.\nIn 2017, Spina bought a Patriots 2016 Super Bowl championship ring from a New England player who then left the team. Prosecutors said Spina paid the player -- identified only as T.J. -- with at least one bad check and sold the ring for $63,000 to an Orange County broker of championship rings.\n\"When Spina obtained the player ring, he also received the information that allowed the former player to purchase Super Bowl rings for family and friends that are slightly smaller than the player rings,\" the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement.\nSpina then called the company that made the rings, claimed to be the former player and ordered three family-and-friend rings with \"Brady\" engraved on them, claiming they were gifts for Brady's baby, prosecutors said.\n\"The rings were at no time authorized by Tom Brady,\" according to the criminal complaint.\nSpina agreed to sell the rings for $81,500 to the same Orange County broker who bought the original ring, contending that Brady had given them to his nephews. The broker later tried to withdraw from the deal because he \"started to believe that Brady did not have nephews,\" according to the U.S. attorney's office.\nIn November 2017, the same day that the buyer tried to back out, Spina sold the rings to an auction house for $100,000 -- much more than he'd paid for them, prosecutors said.\nAt a February 2018 auction, one of them sold for more than $337,000, authorities said.\nSpina pleaded guilty on Feb. 1. to one count of mail fraud, three counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft for posing as the former Patriots player, falsely telling the broker that the family rings were ordered by Brady and defrauding him in connection with three wire transfers for the deposit.\nAt his sentencing, the judge also ordered Spina to pay $63,000 in restitution to the former Patriots player who sold him the genuine Super Bowl ring.",

The stalemate between the quarterback and franchise came to a halt in March of 2021 when the first allegation emerged regarding an incident that reportedly occurred the year before. Within three weeks of the initial lawsuit being filed, a total of 22 had come forward.\nWatson sat the entirety of the 2021 season, his absence listed as \u201cnon-injury related.\u201d\nWatson was not facing criminal charges after two grand juries declined to indict him in March. After the first grand jury declined criminal charges on March 11, the trade market for Watson intensified. The Browns acquired the 26-year-old quarterback on March 18, signing him to a five-year, $230 million contract.\nWhile speaking publicly for the first time in nearly three months at the Browns' practice facility on June 14, Watson continued to maintain his innocence by reiterating that he never committed sexual misconduct.\n\u201cI never assaulted anyone,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI never harassed anyone or I never disrespected anyone. I never forced anyone to do anything.\u201d\nStill, he expressed regret.\n\u201cI do have regrets as far as the impact that on the community and people outside of just myself,\u201d Watson said. \u201cAnd that includes my family. That includes this organization. That includes my teammates in this locker room that have to answer to these questions. That includes the fan base of the Cleveland Browns. That includes males, females, everyone across the, the world. That\u2019s one thing I do regret is the impact that it\u2019s triggered on so many people. It\u2019s tough to have to deal with.\u201d",

Wade.\nThe Red River Women\u2019s Clinic argues that the ban violates the rights to life, safety and happiness guaranteed by the state constitution that protect the right to abortion. It said the ban also infringes on the right to liberty because it \u201cdeprives patients of the ability to control decisions about their families and their health.\u201d\nThe North Dakota lawsuit is just the latest litigation to take aim at restrictions on abortions after the Supreme Court said the procedure was no longer protected by the U.S. Constitution.\nThe suit also questions Attorney General Drew Wrigley\u2019s statement that the ban would take effect July 28. The clinic argued that the Supreme Court released its opinion on June 24 but has not yet issued its judgment, which it said is a necessary step to trigger the state ban. The clinic said the high court typically takes that step at least 25 days after the opinion.\nIn certifying the closure date, Wrigley said \u201cthere\u2019s not any ambiguity\u201d in the Supreme Court decision. He said in a statement Thursday that his office is \u201ccarefully reviewing and evaluating\u201d the complaint, but that he would not comment further until his response is filed.\nAdvertisement\nTammi Kromenaker, owner and operator of the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic in downtown Fargo, has said the facility would move across the river to Moorhead, Minnesota, if necessary but she would explore every legal option to keep it open in North Dakota.\n\u201cWe have faced relentless attacks from North Dakota lawmakers who have long wanted us gone,\u201d Kromenaker said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. \u201cBut we will fight this draconian ban like the other outrageous bans and restrictions that came before it.\u201d\n\u201cIn the meantime, we will keep our doors open to provide abortion care to patients who need us,\u201d she said.\nWrigley and Cass County State\u2019s Attorney Birch Burdick are named as defendants. Burdick said he hasn\u2019t had a chance to discuss the suit with Wrigley and could not comment specifically on it.\n\u201cLike we do on all our cases, we will follow North Dakota law, and any orders made by the court, as those may apply to any fact situations that arise in Cass County,\u201d Burdick said.\n___\nFor AP\u2019s full coverage of the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, go to https://apnews.com/hub/abortion",

John Bel Edwards and the legislature call a special session to rewrite and clarify the state's abortion laws. Nancy Davis, who is 15-weeks pregnant, said that she will travel out of state next week for a \"medically necessary\" abortion. In the 36-year-old's home state of Louisiana, legislation bans all abortions except if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of \"medically futile\" pregnancies. Davis and abortion proponents for months have criticized the state's current abortion laws as vague and confusing. Ten weeks into her pregnancy, Davis found out that the fetus was diagnosed with acrania, a rare and fatal condition where the baby's skull fails to form in the womb. Davis was told that if she gave birth, the baby would likely survive for a very short amount of time \u2014 anywhere from several minutes to a week. Doctors advised Davis to get an abortion, but due to the state's laws they said they could not perform the procedure. In a statement last week to media outlets, a spokesperson for Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge, Caroline Isemann, said the hospital cannot comment on a specific patient but said navigating an unviable pregnancy is extremely complex. Lawmakers argued that Davis fell under the qualifications for an abortion.",

The group said its team counted 14 bullet holes in the burned hulk of the pair\u2019s car, which remained at the spot.\nCiting the findings from its investigation into the deaths, the group said disused Russian positions, one of them still booby-trapped, were found close by. Also found were the remains of food rations, cigarette packs and other litter seemingly left by Russian soldiers.\nSome of Levin and Chernyshov\u2019s belongings, including the soldier\u2019s ID papers and parts of his bulletproof vest and the photographer\u2019s helmet, were also recovered, Reporters Without Borders said.\nA Ukrainian team with metal detectors also located a bullet buried in the soil where Levin\u2019s body had been, it said. The group said that finding suggests \u201che was probably killed with one, perhaps two bullets fired at close range when he was already on the ground.\u201d\nA jerrycan for gasoline was also found close to where Chernyshov\u2019s burned body was found, it added.\nReporters Without Borders said its findings \u201cshow that the two men were doubtless coldly executed.\u201d\nLevin and Chernyshov were last heard from on March 13. A GPS tracker in their vehicle gave their last position, in woods north of Kyiv, the group said.\nThe group speculated that Levin may have been hunting for his drone when he and Chernyshov were killed.\nIt said Levin lost his drone in the area on March 10 and had been unable to recover it because he\u2019d come under Russian fire. Drones have become a common tool for photojournalists to get aerial photos and video.\nReporters Without Borders said Levin had on occasion shared information gleaned from his drone, including about Russian positions, with Ukrainian forces.\n\u201cBut the use of his drone was first and foremost a journalistic endeavor, confirmed by his entourage and shown by the images sold to the media since the start of the Russian invasion,\u201d it said.\nThe group said it turned over the evidence it collected and dozens of photos to Ukrainian investigators.\nThe group said it was unable to confirm whether autopsies were performed on the men\u2019s bodies, a step it called essential for the investigation into their deaths.\nIt also appealed for Ukrainian defense and intelligence agencies to provide investigators with whatever information they have about Russian units that occupied the area during Moscow\u2019s failed assault on Kyiv.\nSeparately, Russian officials said a drone strike caused a fire at an oil processing plant in southwestern Russia on Wednesday.\nThe blaze engulfed a piece of machinery at the Novoshakhtinsk plant in the Rostov-on-Don region. Authorities said that dozens of firefighters quickly contained the fire and no one was hurt.\nThe plant said in a statement that the fire was caused by a strike carried out by two drones, describing it as a \u201cterrorist\u201d act. It didn\u2019t give details, but state news agency Tass reported that two Ukrainian drones flew over the plant and one of them slammed into a heat exchanger, triggering the fire.\nThe regional governor, Vasily Golubev, said that fragments of two drones were found on the territory of the plant.\nUkrainian authorities have not confirmed the strike.\n___\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "article": "Swiss prosecutors have requested for ex- FIFA president Sepp Blatter and vice president Michel Platini to receive a 20-month suspended sentence if they are found guilty of defrauding football's governing body.\nBlatter and Platini were two of the most powerful men in football during their time at the helm of FIFA. Blatter joined the organisation in 1975 and had held the post of president since 1998. Platini is a former three-time Ballon d'Or winner and later became the president of UEFA in 2007.\nThe duo are currently standing trial and the prosecutor could have demanded for them to be sentenced to five years in prison if they are found guilty for financial wrongdoing; although it is anticipated that they would both avoid jail time. The verdicts are expected to be revealed on July 8.\nBlatter and Platini both deny fraud and lesser charges relating to a FIFA-approved payment of 2 million Swiss francs that was made to Platini back in 2011. At the time, Platini was still the president of UEFA and heavily expected to step up from his role of vice president at FIFA to replace Blatter - but his tenure as Blatter's advisor had ended nine years previously.\nProsecutor Thomas Hildbrand also asked the three judges at Switzerland\u2019s federal criminal court for Platini to pay FIFA more than 2.2million francs in compensation in relation to the invoice.\nThe prosecution argued there was no legal or contractual reason for FIFA to pay Platini's invoiced sum for working as a presidential adviser during Blatter's first term at the governing body, which took place between 1998 and 2002.\nThe duo have both previously protested their innocence and instead claim that they had struck a verbal deal back in 1998 to ensure Platini would get an extra 700,000 francs annual payment that FIFA could not afford to pay him at the time. Platini would pen a contract a year later that would see him paid 300,000 francs annually.\nHildbrand assessed on Wednesday that agreeing on such a sum without a written record or witnesses and without provisioning it in the accounts was 'contrary to commercial practices' as well as the habits of FIFA.\nHe also dismissed the notion that the signed invoice from 2011 was for back pay, arguing that FIFA's finances were more than healthy enough to accommodate such an amount back in 1999. He assessed that the organisation 'would have had more than 21m francs in reserves' at the time; a figure that had ballooned to more than 327m francs by 2002.\nThe trial follows a five-year investigation that was carried out over six years since 2015, with the case in question due to run until June 22.",

The NCW has taken cognizance of the reported crime which it said was \"extremely appalling and traumatizing.\"\nThe Commission said that it has been reported that in many settlements of the village, girls are sold for prostitution on stamp paper. \"The National Commission for Women has come across several media posts wherein it has been reported that girls were auctioned off to settle disputes over loan repayments Bhilwara, Rajasthan. It has been further reported that in many settlements of the village, girls are sold for prostitution on stamp paper. In some cases, their mothers are subjected to rape on the diktats of caste panchayats for the settlement of disputes,\" the NCW said in a statement.\nNCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma has also written to Chief Secretary of Rajasthan to take urgent action in the matter and apprise the Commission of the action taken. \"The Commission has taken cognizance of the reported crime which is extremely appalling and traumatizing. The Commission has constituted a two-member Fact Finding Team to look into the matter. Chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan to take urgent action in the matter and apprise the Commission of the action taken,\" the commission said.\nThe Commission has also written to the Director General of Police, Rajasthan to immediately invoke relevant provisions in the FIR and to arrest all the accused at the earliest. Meanwhile, Rajasthan State Commission for Women also took cognizance of media reports that minor girls in some districts of Rajasthan are sold on Stamp Paper and issued notice to the Director General of Police and Bhilwara Collector.\nThe State Commission also demanded immediate action and a factual report in seven days. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights Chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal on Thursday condemned the Bhilwara incident and said that suo-moto cognizance was taken immediately.\nNational Human Rights Commission has also served notice to the Government of Rajasthan on the reported auctioning of girls on stamp papers and the refusal thereof resulting in the rape of their mothers to settle disputes on the diktats of Caste Panchayats in the State. However, Rajasthan minister Pratap Khachariyawas refuted the reports of selling of girls in the State.\n\"It is a matter of investigation. When such information comes out, we can't know the truth until there is a probe. NHRC should have spoken to the Rajasthan police first about this. Selling of girls doesn't happen in the state,\" said Khachariyawas. According to reports carried in media on October 26 this year, caste panchayats in Rajasthan were committing this crime like in Syria and Iraq where girls are enslaved. Reportedly, in Bhilwada, whenever there is any dispute between the two parties, instead of going to the police, the caste panchayats are approached for a settlement. It becomes the starting point of making the girls slaves. It they fail to honour their commitments, there are orders for the mothers of the girls to be raped.",

After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.\nHe became prime minister again in 2012.\nAbe hails from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a great-uncle who served as premier.",

The party had earlier termed the release as \u201cunfortunate\". On November 11, the top court ordered the premature release of six convicts, including Nalini Sriharan, who had hosted the assassin, noting the Tamil Nadu government had recommended remission of their sentence.\nFacing criticism from Congress, the Centre, too, moved to the apex court, seeking a review of its order for the premature release of six convicts.\nThe Centre said the order granting remission to the convicts was passed without affording it an adequate opportunity for hearing despite it being a necessary party to the case.\nAdvertisement\nThe government highlighted the alleged procedural lapse, saying the convicts seeking remission did not formally implead the Centre as a party which resulted in its non-participation in the case. \u201cThus absence of any assistance by the Union of India, due to procedural lapse of convicts/petitioners, while the present matter was being finally heard and decided has prevented this court from appreciating the crucial and important evidence in the matter, which if presented, would have assisted this court to arrive at a just and correct judgment in the matter,\" it had said.\nBesides Nalini, RP Ravichandran, Santhan, Murugan, Robert Payas and Jayakumar walked out of the jail following the Supreme Court order.\nIn its review plea, the central government had said certain facts were in its possession but could not be placed before the court to enable it to arrive at a correct judgment and to do complete justice in the \u201cpeculiar and shocking\" facts and circumstances.\nIt said four out of the six convicts granted remission are Sri Lankans. \u201cGranting remission to terrorist of foreign nation, who had been duly convicted in accordance with the law of land for gruesome offence of assassinating the former Prime Minister of the Country, is a matter which has international ramification and therefore falls squarely within the sovereign powers of the Union of India,\" the review petition said.\nIt said, \u201cIn such a sensitive matter the assistance of Union of India was of paramount importance as the matter has huge repercussions on the public order, peace, tranquility and criminal justice system of the Country.\" On November 11, the top court while ordering the release of the convicts had noted their conduct was satisfactory during incarceration and they had undertaken various studies.\nAdvertisement\nThe apex court said its earlier judgement in the case of AG Perarivalan, one of the convicts released earlier, was equally applicable in the matter of six others. Invoking its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution, the top court had on May 18 ordered the release of Perarivalan, who had served over 30 years in jail.\nThe Tamil Nadu government had earlier favoured the premature release of Nalini and Ravichandran, saying its 2018 advice for remission of their life sentence is binding upon the governor. Nalini, Santhan, Murugan, Perarivalan, Robert Payas, Jayakumar and Ravichandran were sentenced for life.\nAdvertisement\nGandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at an election rally.\nIn its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts Perarivalan, Murugan, Santhan and Nalini.\nHowever, in 2014, it commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment along with those of Santhan and Murugan on grounds of delay in deciding their mercy petitions.\nAdvertisement\nNalini\u2019s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2001 on the consideration that she has a daughter.\nRead all the Latest Politics News here",

As a consequence, amphibians are the most threatened group of vertebrates in the animal world.\nThe loss of hundreds of millions of the amphibians, in turn, has had a serious knock-on impact on biodiversity and the health of broader ecosystems.\n\u201cLarge frog species are dwindling in the wild, one after the other, causing a fatal domino effect for species conservation\u201d, said Dr Sandra Altherr, co-founder of Munich-based Pro Wildlife.",

        "article": "Japan scrambled on Monday to avert a looming power crunch as temperatures climbed nationwide, with authorities warning of higher than expected demand after the rainy season ended in the capital, Tokyo, at its earliest since record-keeping began. Less than two weeks ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament, surging electrical prices are making life tougher for Japanese customers, following higher fuel costs brought by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nA power shortage could batter the fortunes of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, already under fire for its handling of higher consumer prices. \"Electricity demand has been staying above yesterday's forecast since this morning, amid unseasonably intense heat,\" an official of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry told a news conference, adding that demand had outstripped predictions.\nBy 1 p.m., temperatures in downtown Tokyo stood at 34.7 C, while in Sano, slightly to the north, they were at 38.6 C. Ministry officials had warned reserve generating capacity would drop as low as 3.7%, close to a minimum of 3% that ensures stable supply, from 4:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday in Tokyo and eight surrounding prefectures. Below 3% risks power shortages and blackouts.\n\"The supply-demand outlook, based on the latest weather forecast and other factors, is still expected to remain below the 5% reserve ratio during some evening hours,\" the official added. If temperatures rose further and demand increased, or power supply was suddenly disrupted, the ratio could fall below the 3% minimum, he said.\n\"We encourage people to cut back on energy use to a reasonable degree,\" deputy chief cabinet secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki told a news conference. He advised turning off lights not in use, limiting the use of air conditioners, and guarding against the risk of heat stroke.\nWeather officials said the end of the annual rainy season across much of Japan, including the Tokyo metropolitan area, had come at its earliest since the data began to be kept in 1951. Summer heat starts with the end of Japan's rainy season. In 2018, the June 29 end of the season brought an extremely hot summer with several heat waves that put thousands in hospital.\nThough expected to do well in the election, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling LDP faces headwinds from rising prices, worsened by a weak yen currency. Support for his government, while still strong, has been edging lower in opinion polls, with a majority of voters unhappy about its efforts to rein in prices.\nSince spring, utilities and the government have taken steps to avert a power crunch during the peak season of summer demand. They have urged families and businesses to conserve energy between July 1 and Sept. 30, while rebooting aging gas-fired power plants and altering maintenance plans for nuclear reactors.",

It then travels to the brain, where it destroys the brain tissue. \"This infection cannot be spread from one person to another, and it cannot be contracted by swallowing contaminated water,\" the health department wrote.\nPAM is extremely rare. There have been 154 known cases in the U.S. since 1962, and authorities said no additional suspected cases of PAM are currently being investigated in either Missouri or Iowa, and this is believed to be the first case discovered in Iowa. Though rare, the condition is extremely dangerous. Only four people out of the 154 known infected individuals in the U.S. from 1962 to 2021 survived.\n\"It's the worst parasite in the world that we know of because it causes such devastating pathology,\" Christopher Rice, a research scientist in the Center for Drug Discovery at the University of Georgia, told CBS. A sample of cerebral spinal fluid is needed to confirm a person has been infected with the parasite, he said, noting it is a difficult condition to diagnose.\n\"While this infection is extremely rare in the United States, people who experience the following symptoms after swimming in any warm body of water should contact their health care provider immediately,\" the health department wrote, listing severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and stiff neck as symptoms of which to be aware.\nSymptoms can then progress to include seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations and coma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms appear one to nine days after being infected, the CDC says. People typically die one to 18 days after symptoms begin.\n\"Overall, the outlook for people who get this disease is poor, although early diagnosis and new treatments might increase the chances for survival,\" the CDC says.\nRelated Stories",

        "article": "Firefighters worked Thursday to put out the remnants of two wildfires on a Sicilian island that forced fashion designer Giorgio Armani and dozens of others to flee their vacation villas overnight. A photo from the island of Pantelleria showed flames appearing to encroach on Armani's villa, but the Italian designer's press office said they stopped short of the property. Armani and guests evacuated to a boat in the harbor.\nThe head of the region's civil protection agency, Salvatore Cocina, said arson was suspected in two wildfires that forced around 30 people to seek refuge in boats or on safer parts of the island. Firefighters used Canadair planes to douse the flames, along with ground teams to protect homes. Authorities said no structures appeared to have been lost. The island's mayor, Vincenzo Campo, told Italian news agency ANSA that two planes were working on putting out the last flames on difficult terrain and that the wind had dropped off. ''After the great fear of last evening and the night spent at work, Pantelleria is returning to normal,'' Campo said. \u201cIt seems the worst is over.\u201d Local officials appealed for any information that would help identify the cause of the blaze, which started in two places 400 meters apart.\nPantelleria, located between Sicily and Tunisia, is a popular beach and trekking destination that includes ancient archaeological sites and natural geographic formations.\nScientists say global warming will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Much of western Europe saw little rain this summer, and drought conditions coupled with hot weather have fueled destructive forest fires. So far this summer, wildfires in Spain have blackened more than 700,000 hectares, the largest area since the European Union started collecting satellite data in 2006. The EU's Earth Observation Program said more torrid weather was forecast for Spain as two \u201cdisastrous\u201d wildfires burned in the eastern part of the country. The fires in the Mediterranean provinces of Alicante and Castell\u00f3n have each charred more than 13,000 hectares, the EU agency said.\nMeanwhile, authorities in Portugal reported that a wildfire burning for almost two weeks in the pine forests of Serra da Estrela national park was brought under control. However, officials warned of weather forecasts indicating a dangerous new heat wave would arrive soon. High temperatures, strong winds and a severe drought helped sustain the blaze in the park, where deep ravines and steep hillsides make firefighting difficult. More than 1,100 firefighters remained in the Serra da Estrela, keeping an eye out for hot spots and embers that might be blown into untouched forest, the Civil Protection Agency, a government department, said.\nThe blaze charred more than 26,000 hectares of woodland, according to European Union data -- about one-fourth of the park's area.\nOn Wednesday, the fire's perimeter measured 160 kilometers, emergency officials said, and jumped 125-meter-wide firebreaks that had been cleared since the area's last major blaze, in 2017.\nFire officials said that was an indication the country is fighting a \u201cnew generation\u201d of wildfires that are harder to stop amid the consequences of climate change.\nTemperatures in Portugal were due to start climbing, reaching 39 degrees Celsius in inland areas on Saturday, as the country endures its third heat wave of the summer.",

        "article": "New Delhi: Amid protests in several parts of the country over the Center\u2019s \u2018Agnipath\u2019 Yojana, Congress on Thursday said the armed forces recruitment scheme is \u201ccontroversial\u201d and carries \u201cmultiple risks\u201d. In a statement, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said the short-term recruitment scheme may turn out to be a case of \"penny wise and security foolish\". He claimed that many retired defence officers have almost unanimously opposed the scheme, adding that he believes that many serving officers share the same view. The Central government\u2019s Agnipath scheme aims to recruit soldiers in the Army, Navy and the Air Force mainly on a four-year short-term contractual basis, after which most of them will have to compulsorily retire without pension.\n\"The Agnipath scheme is controversial, carries multiple risks, subverts the long-standing traditions and ethos of the armed forces and there is no guarantee that the soldiers recruited under the scheme will be better trained and motivated to defend the country,\" Chidambaram said.\nMy opening statement at the AICC press conference today: pic.twitter.com/NigIYMRC9e \u2014 P. Chidambaram June 16, 2022\nRaising several doubts about the Agnipath scheme, the senior Congress leader in a statement urged the Center to keep it in abeyance and hold consultations with serving and retired officers.\nCongress\u2019 apprehension of Agnipath scheme\nThe former Union minister said Agnipath soldiers will be trained for six months, will serve for another 42 months, and after that period 75 per cent of the recruits will be discharged. \"It appears to us that the scheme makes a mockery of training; inducts into the defence forces an ill-trained and ill-motivated soldier; and discharges a disappointed and unhappy ex-soldier into the society,\" he said.\nThe Congress leader said announcements by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Education on opportunities after the recruitment period ends appear to be \"after-thoughts\".\nALSO READ: \u2018Agnipath\u2019 scheme: Rahul Gandhi hits out at Centre, says govt must \u2018stop compromising\u2019 dignity, traditions of armed forces\n\"They show that the scheme was poorly conceived and hastily drawn up. A major change in the mode of recruitment should have been examined thoroughly and a pilot scheme should have been tried and tested. Nothing of that sort has been done,\" the Congress leader said. Further, he claimed that several experts have suggested alternative models to address the inadequate armed forces recruitment issue, however, it does not seem that the alternatives were examined.\n\"Given the situation on our borders, it is imperative that we have soldiers in our defence forces who are young, well-trained, motivated, happy, satisfied and assured of their future,\" the former Union minister added.\nProtests against Agnipath scheme\nSeveral youngsters in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr and Ballia districts held protests against the Agnipath scheme today. The protesters in Khurja locality and the city area of Bulandshahr also raised slogans against the central government demanding the withdrawal of defence services recruitment scheme, PTI reported.\nHundreds of youth took to the streets in Haryana's Gurugram, Rewari and Palwal against the Agnipath scheme, with many blocking highways. A police vehicle was also damaged in stone-pelting in Palwal.\nProtests turned violent in Bihar as at least three trains were set on fire in Chhapra, Gopalganj and Kaimur districts today.",

LOUIS \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to forgive student loan debt for millions of borrowers was handed another legal loss Monday when a federal appeals court panel agreed to a preliminary injunction halting the program while an appeal plays out.\nThe ruling by the three-judge panel from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis came days after a federal judge in Texas blocked the program, saying it usurped Congress\u2019 power to make laws. The Texas case was appealed and the administration is likely to appeal the 8th Circuit ruling as well.\nThe plan would cancel $10,000 in student loan debt for those making less than $125,000 or households with less than $250,000 in income. Pell Grant recipients, who typically demonstrate more financial need, would get an additional $10,000 in debt forgiven. The cancellation applies to federal student loans used to attend undergraduate and graduate school, along with Parent Plus loans.\nThe Congressional Budget Office has said the program will cost about $400 billion over the next three decades.\nA federal judge on Oct. 20 allowed the program to proceed, but the 8th Circuit the next day temporarily put it on hold while it considered an effort by the states of Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas and South Carolina to block the loan forgiveness plan.\nThe new ruling from the panel made up of three Republican appointees \u2014 one was appointed by President George W. Bush and two by President Donald Trump \u2014 extends the hold until the issue is resolved in court.\nPart of the states\u2019 argument centered around the financial harm the debt cancellation would cause the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority.\n\u201cThis unanticipated financial downturn will prevent or delay Missouri from funding higher education at its public colleges and universities,\u201d the 8th Circuit ruling stated.\nNebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, a Republican, said in a statement that the ruling \u201crecognizes that this attempt to forgive over $400 billion in student loans threatens serious harm to the economy that cannot be undone. It is important to stop the Biden administration from such unlawful abuse of power.\u201d\nA message seeking comment from the White House wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\nBoth federal cases centered around the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, commonly known as the HEROES Act. It was enacted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, allowing the secretary of education to waive or modify terms of federal loans in times of war or national emergency.\nLawyers for the administration contend the COVID-19 pandemic created a national emergency and that student loan defaults have skyrocketed over the past 2\u00bd years.\nBut in the Texas ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman \u2014 an appointee of Trump based in Fort Worth \u2014 said the HEROES ACT did not provide the authorization that the Biden administration claimed it did.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said that so far, 26 million people had applied for debt relief, and 16 million people had already had their relief approved. The Department of Education would \u201cquickly process their relief once we prevail in court,\u201d she said after the ruling in Texas.\nThe legal challenges have created confusion about whether borrowers who expected to have debt canceled will have to resume making payments come Jan. 1, when a pause prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic is set to expire.\nEconomists worry that many people have yet to rebound financially from the pandemic, saying that if borrowers who were expecting debt cancellation are asked to make payments instead, many could fall behind on the bills and default.",

Mr. Rapp, at the start of his own Broadway career at the time, said he was able to \u201cswerve my way out\u201d but that the experience scarred him.\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan earlier on Monday dismissed Mr. Rapp\u2019s emotional distress claim, but allowed the battery claim to stand.\nMr. Spacey took the stand in his own defense in Manhattan federal court and said the allegation was \u201cnot true,\u201d and that he had never been alone with Mr. Rapp. He testified that he was \u201cshocked\u201d when Mr. Rapp went public with his claim in a 2017 article in Buzzfeed. Following the article, Mr. Spacey released a statement in which he came out as gay and apologized to Mr. Rapp for any inappropriate behavior.\nOn Monday, Mr. Spacey said he now regrets his apology.\n\u201cI have learned a lesson, which is never apologize for something you didn\u2019t do,\u201d Mr. Spacey said. \u201cI regret my entire statement,\u201d he added.\nMr. Spacey broke down in tears, saying that he wanted to do something positive by coming out but was viewed as trying to change the subject from Mr. Rapp\u2019s abuse claim\n\u201cI would never have done anything to hurt the gay community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\nMr. Spacey is scheduled to be cross-examined when the trial resumes on Tuesday.\nMr. Rapp, who starred in the Broadway musical Rent, sued Mr. Spacey in November 2020, seeking $40 million in damages. Last week, Mr. Spacey\u2019s lawyer challenged Mr. Rapp\u2019s memory of the 1986 incident during cross-examination, questioning him on why he described the encounter as having occurred in a bedroom when Mr. Spacey lived in a studio at the time.\nMr. Spacey won Oscars for performances in American Beauty and The Usual Suspects, but his career largely ended after more than 20 men accused him of sexual misconduct. Netflix dropped him from its political drama series House of Cards and Christopher Plummer replaced him in the role of J. Paul Getty in All the Money in the World weeks before the movie\u2019s scheduled release in 2017.\nMr. Spacey faces a criminal trial in London next year after pleading not guilty to five sex offense charges over alleged assaults between 2005 and 2013. \u2014 Reuters",

Also, the \u2018Valmiki Gurupeetha\u2019 seer Prasannananda Swami has been on a hunger strike demanding the ST quota hike.\nThe Opposition parties, especially the Congress had been attacking the government for the delay in implementation.\nMany have doubts whether this decision would stand the test of legal scrutiny as reservation would now exceed the 50 per cent cap, the Chief Minister said adding that as per the Indra Sawhney case the STs who are away from the mainstream socially and educationally can be considered as a special case and reservation can be given.\nHe said both Justice H N Nagamohan Das and Justice Subhash B Adi committee have clearly mentioned in their reports as to how this Karnataka\u2019s hike in quota is a special case, by noting that reservation should be proportional to population, and by highlighting education and social backwardness of these communities with figures.\n\u201cSo, basically, there are strong grounds.\u201d \u201cFurther, in various States where there is a good number of SC/ST population like \u2013 Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu- the reservation has crossed 50 per cent.\nAlso the Centre had made a constitutional amendment to provide reservation for economically weaker sections crossing the 50 per cent cap,\u201d he said pointing out that though both these have been challenged in courts; there are no adverse judgements so far.\nResponding to a question, Bommai said the government would take appropriate decisions regarding internal reservation demand among the SCs/STs, after thoroughly studying the Sadashiva Commission report and court judgements in this regard, and duly consulting experts, leaders and all stakeholders.\nThe Cabinet today also decided to set up a development corporation for the Alemari communities.\nRead all the Latest News India and Breaking News here",

It's dehumanising.\"\nIn a statement quoted by the Washington Post, the CBP's Mr Magnus said the border agency expects its staff to \"treat all migrants we encounter with respect.\"\n\"An internal investigation has been opened to address this matter,\" his statement said.\nAccording to CBP statistics published online, nearly 13,000 Indian citizens have been detained by Border Patrol officers at the US-Mexico border in the fiscal year that began in October.\nOf these, about three-quarters - nearly 10,000 - have been detained in the Border Patrol's Yuma sector, a 202 km expanse of desert and rocky mountains that stretches from California's Imperial Sand Dunes to the border between Arizona's Yuma and Pima counties. In 2019, a six-year-old Indian citizen from the Punjab was found dead near the Arizona town of Lukeville in a high-profile case.\nAuthorities later said the little girl died of heatstroke in extreme temperatures of over 42 C after her mother left her with another group of migrants to go and search for water.",

But attorneys for Paxton\u2019s wife of 30 years, Louise, and their two children, James and Lydia, filed a notice in Los Angeles Superior Court that they had agreed to settle the case.\n\u201cThe matter has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Bruce Broillet and Steve Heimberg said in a statement.\nThe terms are confidential, the attorneys said. Emails seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned. The agreement must still be approved by a judge.\nPaxton, who starred in films including \u201cApollo 13,\u201d \u201cTitanic\u201d and \u201cAliens\u201d and in television series including \u201cBig Love,\u201d died on Feb. 25, 2017.\nThe cause was a stroke that came 11 days after surgery to replace a heart valve and repair aorta damage, according to his death certificate.\nThe lawsuit, filed a year later, alleged that the surgeon, Dr. Ali Khoynezhad, used a \u201chigh risk and unconventional surgical approach\u201d that was unnecessary and that he lacked the experience to perform, and that he downplayed the procedure\u2019s risks.\nThe misguided treatment caused Paxton to suffer excessive bleeding, cardiogenic shock and a compromised coronary artery, the suit alleged, and said that Cedars-Sinai knew that Khoynezhad, tended to \u201cengage in maverick surgeries and show suboptimal judgment.\u201d\nThe defendants said in court documents that Paxton and his family knew and understood the risks involved in the procedure, and voluntarily went on with the surgery. The defendants\u2019 said there was no negligence that led to his death.\nThe four-year legal battle was marked by frequent attempts by the Paxton family to extract more discovery evidence from the hospital, and frequent court hearings over the issue.\nPaxton, who was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, was among the industry\u2019s busiest actors from the early 1980s until his death, amassing nearly 100 credits, including \u201cTwister\u201d and \u201cWeird Science.\u201d He was starring in the CBS drama series \u201cTraining Day\u201d when he died.\n___\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton\n___ This story has been updated to correct the date of Paxton\u2019s death.",

        "article": "London | Reuters: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson survived a confidence vote on Monday but a large rebellion in his Conservative Party over the so-called \"partygate\" scandal dealt a blow to his authority and leaves him with a struggle to win back support.\nJohnson, who scored a sweeping election victory in 2019, has been under increasing pressure after he and staff held alcohol-fuelled parties in his Downing Street office and residence when Britain was under lockdowns to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe vote was a blow to Johnson, with 41% of his lawmakers casting ballots against his leadership after months of scandals and gaffes that has raised questions over his authority to govern Britain and knocked his standing among the public.\nBut Johnson, a master of political comebacks, instead described the vote as a \"decisive result\" meaning that \"as a government we can move on and focus on the stuff that I think really matters to people\".\n\"We can focus on what we're doing to help people with the cost of living, what we're doing to clear the COVID backlogs, what we're doing to make streets and communities safer by putting more police out,\" said Johnson, who for weeks has tried to move the national conversation away from \"partygate\".\nIt is a change of fortune for Johnson and underlines the depth of anger against him. He was met with a chorus of jeers and boos, and some muted cheers, at events to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth in recent days.\nSeveral lawmakers said the vote, which saw 211 lawmakers cast ballots in favour of Johnson against 148, was worse than expected for a prime minister, once seemingly unassailable after winning the Conservatives' largest majority in more than three decades.\n\"Boris Johnson will be relieved at this vote. But he will also understand that the next priority is to rebuild the cohesion of the party,\" David Jones, a former minister, told Reuters. \"I am sure he will be equal to the challenge.\"\nOthers were less optimistic, with one Conservative lawmaker saying on condition of anonymity: \"It is clearly much worse than most people were expecting. But it is too early to say what will happens now.\"\nRoger Gale, a long-time critic of Johnson, urged the prime minister \"to go back to Downing Street tonight and consider very carefully where he goes from here\".\n12-MONTH REPRIEVE\nBy winning the confidence vote, Johnson has secured a reprieve for 12 months when lawmakers cannot bring another challenge. But his predecessor Theresa May scored better in her 2018 confidence vote only to resign six months later.\nDozens of Conservative lawmakers have voiced concern over whether Johnson, 57, has lost his authority to govern Britain, which is facing the risk of recession, rising fuel and food prices and strike-inflicted travel chaos in the capital London.\nBut his Cabinet rallied around him and highlighted what they said were the successes of the government: a quick rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations and Britain's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nA majority of the Conservatives' lawmakers - at least 180 - would have had to vote against Johnson for him to be removed.\nEarlier, a spokesperson for Johnson's Downing Street office said the vote would \"allow the government to draw a line and move on\" and that the prime minister welcomed the opportunity to make his case to lawmakers.\nJohnson, a former London mayor, rose to power at Westminster as the face of the Brexit campaign in a 2016 referendum, and won the 2019 election with the slogan to \"get Brexit done\".\nJacob Rees-Mogg, Brexit opportunities minister, told Sky News that completing Britain's departure from the European Union would be \"significantly at risk without his drive and energy\".\nJohnson has locked horns with Brussels over Northern Ireland, raising the prospect of more barriers for British trade and alarming leaders in Ireland, Europe and the United States about risks to the province's 1998 peace deal.\nBut it was the months of stories of what went on in Downing Street, including fights and alcohol-induced vomiting, when many people were prevented from saying goodbye to loved ones at funerals, that did the real damage.\nThe move led to lawmakers from different wings of the party revealing that they had turned against their leader. One former ally accused the prime minister of insulting both the electorate and the party by staying in power.\n\"You have presided over a culture of casual law-breaking at 10 Downing Street in relation to COVID,\" Jesse Norman, a former junior minister, said before the vote.\nJohnson's anti-corruption chief John Penrose also quit.\nPosted By: Aalok Sensharma",

        "article": "The glorious dream of Margot Robbie leading a band of lady pirates is now dead. The actress told Vanity Fair that her female-led take on Pirates of the Caribbean with Birds of Prey screenwriter Christiana Hodson is no longer going forward at Disney.\n\u201cWe had an idea and we were developing it for a while, ages ago, to have more of a female-led \u2014 not totally female-led, but just a different kind of story \u2014 which we thought would\u2019ve been really cool. But I guess they don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Robbie said.\nThe project was first announced back in 2020, along with another separate reboot. In May 2022, Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer behind all five Pirates of the Caribbean movies, told The Sunday Times that the projects were still in development. What happened in between then and Robbie\u2019s recent statement is unclear \u2014 nor is the fate of the second project.\nIf Robbie is to be believed, it feels like Disney is missing out on an opportunity here, especially with HBO\u2019s Our Flag Means Death bringing pirate media like Black Sails back into the zeitgeist. But even despite that, it\u2019s sad to see the project shoved into Davy Jones\u2019 locker, because a female-forward interpretation of the swashbuckling franchise is the absolute perfect evolution for it.\nMost people remember Johnny Depp\u2019s roguish Jack Sparrow, but one thing that made the original three Pirates of the Caribbean movies stand out was just how female-centric it was for a big fantasy genre film. By making governor\u2019s daughter Elizabeth Swann such a central character, the filmmakers \u2014 whether intentionally or not \u2014 made the movies appeal specifically to young girls. After all, it\u2019s Elizabeth who goes on the clear hero\u2019s journey, from kidnapped damsel to stowaway sailor and eventually Pirate King.\nWithout ever intending it, the Pirates of the Caribbean movies became the ultimate girlhood fantasy. Admittedly, there weren\u2019t a whole lot of other women for Elizabeth to fight alongside, but that just makes a new Pirates movie centered around some badass ladies the natural next step. Instead of leaning into the Jack Sparrow of it all, the Pirates franchise could actually embrace what made those first three movies so damn special. Especially since the fifth movie discounted so much of her growth \u2014 you\u2019re telling me that Pirate King Elizabeth Swann, who already went to hell and back for Will Turner, wouldn\u2019t immediately get on a ship and sail with him to the ends of the Earth?\nAlas, we might never see Margot Robbie and her crew sail the seven seas. Maybe one day, in the distant future, beyond the horizon, Disney will realize that the key to cracking that franchise after two meh sequels is just making it unapologetically tailored towards girls.",

AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\nJERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office announced Monday that his weakened coalition will be disbanded and the country will head to new elections.\nThe election, expected in October or November, would be Israel\u2019s fifth in three years. The election could also set the stage for a return to power by longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now the opposition leader.\nBennett has struggled to keep his unruly coalition of eight parties together since it took office one year ago, and defections have left the crumbling alliance without a majority in parliament for over two months.\nBennett and his main coalition partner, Yair Lapid, decided to present a vote to dissolve parliament in the coming days, Bennett's office said. Lapid is then to serve as caretaker prime minister.\nBennett formed the eight-party coalition in June 2021 after four successive inconclusive elections. It included a diverse array of parties, from dovish factions that support an end to Israel's occupation of lands captured in 1967, to hardline parties that oppose Palestinian independence. It made history by becoming the first Israeli coalition government to include an Arab party.\nThe alliance made a series of accomplishments, including passing the first national budget in several years and navigating a pair of coronavirus outbreaks without imposing any lockdowns.\nBut eventually it unraveled, in large part because several members of Bennett's hard-line party objected to what they felt were compromises made by him to keep the coalition afloat and his perceived moderation.\nThe dissolution threatened to overshadow a visit scheduled next month by President Joe Biden. Israeli media quoted Biden's ambassador, Tom Nides, as saying the visit would take place as planned.\nNetanyahu said the imminent dissolution of parliament was \u201cgreat tidings\u201d for millions of Israelis, and said he would form \u201ca broad nationalist government headed by Likud\u201d after the upcoming elections.\nIsrael held four inconclusive elections between 2019 and 2021 that were largely referendums about Netanyahu\u2019s ability to rule while on trial for corruption. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.\nOpinion polls have forecast that Netanyahu\u2019s hardline Likud will once again emerge as the largest single party. But it remains unclear whether he would be able to muster the required support of a majority of lawmakers to form a new government.\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

However, officials had said that was only a remote possibility.\nSoud said he intends to appeal Fitton\u2019s sentence immediately.

        "article": "Washington [US], June 24: A number of new features will be added to the most recent version of Chrome for iOS, Google announced today as part of a larger update to the Chrome web browser.\nAccording to TechCrunch, the Google Enhanced Safe Browsing feature, which alerts you proactively to risky web pages, is one of the Chrome app's major new features. Other updates include alterations to the user interface, the option to designate Google's password manager as the source for autofill, a new language identification model, and more.\nSome of these adjustments have been made for months or even years on Android and Chrome for desktop computers, but they are just now being made available on iOS.\nFor instance, in this update, Enhanced Safe Browsing, which has been accessible on Android and Chrome for desktop computers, is now available on iPhones and iPads. By sending real-time data to Google Safe Browsing for scanning for threats like malware, phishing, and other dangers, this feature can anticipate and alert users to risky websites.\nUsers of iOS devices will also receive notifications from Chrome about compromised credentials, allowing them to change their usernames and passwords as necessary.\nUsers can activate Enhanced Safe Browsing on their iPhone or iPad via Chrome > More > Settings > Enhanced Safe Browsing after the app has been updated.\nA further iOS feature is \"Chrome Actions,\" which makes it simpler to complete specific tasks without having to tinker with the app's settings. For instance, you can type commands like \"Clear Browsing Data,\" \"Open Incognito Tab,\" or \"Set Chrome as Default Browser\" into the browser's address bar. Following that, the app will immediately direct you to the appropriate page.\nYou don't need to know the correct command because the Chrome address bar can predict when a user might benefit from a Chrome Action based on the words being typed. Both desktop and Android versions of this have been accessible since April of 2020.\nAlong with providing an alternative to the built-in password management system, the update will also enable users to designate Google Password Manager as their Autofill provider, competing with other password utilities like 1Password or Dashlane.\nWhen enabled, Chrome can assist users in managing and filling out their passwords for any mobile app or website on their iOS device. Prior to now, the feature was accessible on Chrome for Android and desktop.\nThe main screen of Chrome's interface has been updated to display more than just your most recent tabs. You'll see that the app now provides access to the same Discover feed of tailored content that can usually be found on the Google mobile app's home page. Google mentions that this will eventually be available on Android Chrome.\nGoogle is also enhancing Chrome's website translation function, which makes websites available in the language of your choice using on-device machine learning.

He also sent offerings to Yasukuni during festivals last year and this spring.\n\u201cWe will never again repeat the horrors of war. I will continue to live up to this determined oath,\u201c Kishida told a secular gathering elsewhere in Tokyo, also attended by Emperor Naruhito.\n\u201cIn a world where conflicts are still unabated, Japan is a proactive leader in peace,\u201c he said.\nFootage on broadcaster NHK showed the shrine being visited early on Monday by several cabinet ministers, including Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi. Earlier the site was visited by Koichi Hagiuda, the head of the LDP\u2019s policy research council and a key ally of slain former prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\u201cIt is natural for any country to pay respect to those who gave their lives for their country,\u201c chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said earlier on Monday. \u201cJapan will continue to strengthen its relations with its neighbours, including China and South Korea.\u201d\nA group of lawmakers that normally visit en masse on Aug 15 said last week they would not do so due to a recent surge in coronavirus cases.\nAbe was the last prime minister in recent memory to visit Yasukuni while in office, in 2013 - a visit that outraged both China and South Korea and even drew a rebuke from its close ally the United States.\nThe United States and Japan have become staunch security allies in the decades since the war\u2019s end, but its legacy still haunts East Asia.\nKoreans, who mark the date as National Liberation Day, resent Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonisation of the peninsula, while China has bitter memories of imperial troops\u2019 invasion and occupation of parts of the country from 1931-1945.\nKishida has pledged to substantially increase Japan\u2019s defence budget, citing the increasingly tense regional security environment, but made no mention in a recent speech of one of Abe\u2019s dreams - revising the country\u2019s pacifist constitution - although he has spoken of it before. - Reuters",

Please evacuate into buildings or underground.\"\nThe UN prohibits North Korea from testing ballistic and nuclear weapons. Flying missiles towards or over other countries without any warning or consultation also contravenes international norms.\nNorth Korea's missile launch on Tuesday was the fifth carried out by Pyongyang in a week.\nStory continues\nMany of its missile tests are conducted on a flight path that reaches a high altitude, avoiding flights over its neighbours.\nBut firing over or past Japan allows North Korean scientists to test missiles under circumstances \"that are more representative of the conditions they'd endure in real-world use\", analyst Ankit Panda told news agency Reuters.\nThese actions have contributed to enduring tensions between North Korea and Japan, rooted in Japan's colonisation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and the North's abduction of Japanese citizens in the past.\nIn September, North Korea passed a law declaring itself to be a nuclear weapons state, with leader Kim Jong-un ruling out the possibility of talks on denuclearisation.",

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.\nAt Wednesday's signing, the lead negotiator for Tigray described it as containing \"painful concessions.\"\nOne of the pact's priorities is to swiftly disarm Tigray forces of heavy weapons, and take away their \"light weapons\" within 30 days. Senior commanders on both sides are to meet within five days.\nEthiopian security forces will take full control of \"all federal facilities, installations, and major infrastructure ... within the Tigray region,\" and an interim regional administration will be established after dialogue between the parties, the accord says. The terrorist designation for the Tigray People's Liberation Front party will be lifted.\nIf implemented, the agreement should mark an end to the devastating conflict in Africa's second-most populous country. Millions of people have been displaced and many left near famine under a blockade of the Tigray region of more than 5 million people. Abuses have been documented on all sides.\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed asserted that his government received everything it asked for in the peace talks.\n\"During the negotiation in South Africa, Ethiopia's peace proposal has been accepted 100%,\" and the government is ready to \"open our hearts\" for peace to prevail, Abiy said in a speech. He added that the issue of contested areas, seen as one of the most difficult, will be resolved only through the law of the land and negotiations.\nNeither Ethiopian government nor Tigray negotiators responded to questions.\nAs part of the full agreement, both sides agreed not to make any unilateral statement that would undermine it. The deal also calls for the immediate \"cessation of all forms of hostile propaganda, rhetoric and hate speech.\" The conflict has been marked by language that U.S. special envoy Mike Hammer, who helped with the peace talks, has described as having \"a high level of toxicity.\"\n\"The human cost of this conflict has been devastating. I urge all Ethiopians to seize this opportunity for peace,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Thursday, one of many messages from observers expressing cautious hope.\nEnormous challenges lie ahead. The opaque and repressive government of neighboring Eritrea, whose forces have fought alongside Ethiopian ones, has not commented, and it was not clear whether Eritrean forces had begun to withdraw. The agreement says Ethiopian forces will be deployed along the borders and \"ensure that there will be no provocation or incursion from either side of the border.\"\nMustafa Yusuf Ali, an analyst with the Horn International Institute for Strategic Studies, said trust-building will be crucial. The agreement \"needs to be coordinated, it needs to be systematic, and above all it needs to be sequenced so that the Tigrayans are not left to their devices after handing in all their weapons then suddenly they are attacked by the center,\" he said.\nThe agreement sets deadlines for disarmament but little else, although it says Ethiopia's government will \"expedite the provision of humanitarian aid\" and \"expedite and coordinate the restoration of essential services in the Tigray region within agreed time frames.\"\nThe United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross said they had not yet resumed the delivery of humanitarian aid to Tigray, whose communication, transportation and banking links have been largely severed since fighting began. Some basic medicines have run out.\n\"It's not surprising that it may take a little bit of time to get the word out to the competent authorities in the field. We are in touch with them and trying to get that unimpeded access as soon as possible,\" the spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, Stephane Dujarric, told reporters.\nInside Tigray, one humanitarian worker in the town of Shire said there had been no sounds of gunfire over the past few days but people and vehicles were still blocked from moving freely. The worker spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\nResidents of the Tigray regional capital, Mekele, nervously waited for next steps.\nAsked about the peace agreement, resident Gidey Tsadik replied, \"It's good. Everyone is happy. However, it's not known when exactly we will have that peace.\"\nTedros Hiwot said residents hadn't heard when basic services will resume. \"We need it to happen quickly,\" he said.\nTigrayans outside the region said they still could not reach their families by phone. \"I hope that this will be an opportunity to reconnect with my family,\" said Andom Gebreyesus, who lives in Kenya. \"I miss them and I don't know if they are alive.\"\nAt a memorial service in the capital, Addis Ababa, for soldiers killed in the conflict, Defense Minister Abraham Belay spoke of \"the very complex and tough reconstruction work that lies ahead of us.\"\n------\nAssociated Press writers Desmond Tiro in Nairobi, Kenya, and Edith M.

But the visit gives Putin the opportunity to show that he is not isolated despite widespread sanctions and denunciations from the West because of the Ukraine operation.\nAt the first stop in Tajikistan, Putin is to meet with authoritarian President Emomali Rahmon, who has been in office since 1994 and kept his country close to Russia. Tajikistan hosts some 7,000 Russian troops, Moscow's largest base abroad.\nPutin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said Monday that a key part of the talks with Rahmon will be discussing measures to improve security along Tajikistan's porous, 1,357-kilometer border with Afghanistan.\n. .\nTajikistan, where a 1990s civil war that included Islamist insurgents killed as many as 100,000 people, is wary of Islamic radicalism spilling over from Afghanistan. It also is a main route for heroin and opium smuggling from Afghanistan.\nRussia is following a narrow path with Afghanistan - although it officially designates the ruling Taliban as a terrorist group, the Taliban also have a representation in Moscow and one of the movement's officials was invited to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June.\nThe Kremlin \"encourages the new Afghan authorities to form an ethnically and politically balanced government and intensify actions for combatting terrorist and drug threats,\" Ushakov said.\nPutin on Wednesday is to be in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, which largely seals itself off from the world. The purpose is to attend a summit of Caspian Sea littoral states, which also include Azerbaijan, Iran and Kazakhstan.\nKazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev raised eyebrows at the St. Petersburg forum when, while appearing on stage with Putin, he firmly stated that Kazakhstan would not recognise the two separatist Ukrainian regions that Russia has declared to be sovereign states.",

Seconds later, the rival player fell to the court,\u201d prosecutors said.\nA county superior court judge on Wednesday granted Hunt misdemeanor diversion in exchange for completing a series of requirements over the next two years, including writing an apology to the victim, her parents and both basketball teams, prosecutors said.\nLatira Shonty Hunt was in the stands of a game in Garden Grove on Nov. 7, 2021, and after her daughter had an on-court interaction with an opposing player, Hunt allegedly yelled, \u201cYou better hit her for that.\nShe was also ordered to pay more than $9,000 in restitution and complete anger management classes before she can attend basketball games again, prosecutors said. Hunt was also ordered to stay away from the victim, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.\nHunt could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday. It was unclear if she was represented by an attorney.\nThe game last year was between the SoCal Blaze and Dream Academy. In a video of the incident that went viral, a 14-year-old player from Dream Academy can be seen missing a 3-point shot, NBC Los Angeles reported.\nImmediately afterward, the Dream Academy player can be seen falling to the floor. A player beside her \u2014 identified to NBC Los Angeles by her mother, Alice Ham, as Lauryn Ham, 15 \u2014 also falls.\nAfter she gets back up, the Dream Academy player can be seen lunging toward Lauryn and striking her in the head. She immediately crumples to the floor.\nStory continues\nLauryn was diagnosed with a concussion after the game, Alice Ham told NBC Los Angeles.\nOrange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in the statement that Hunt was responsible for injuring the teenager.\n\u201cYouth sports play a crucial role in developing discipline, teamwork and fair play. A grown adult directing a child to use violence against another child on the basketball court is reprehensible,\u201d Spitzer said. \u201cBy instructing her own daughter to engage in violence, she is not only responsible for injuring an innocent child as if she punched her with her own fist, but she transformed her own child into someone who is willing to hurt another child.\u201d\nIn the days after the game, the father of the Dream Academy player, Corey Benjamin, 44, a former first-round draft pick for the Chicago Bulls who played for the team from 1998 to 2003, apologized for his daughter. He told NBC Los Angeles in a statement that he was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by her behavior.\n\u201cThis is not a reflection of the values and standards that my family holds,\u201d he said. \u201cNor does it exemplify the values, character and spirit of sportsmanship that the game of basketball requires. My daughter made a mistake. One that she will need to make right. I am committed to getting my daughter any help she may need and support her in taking accountability for her conduct.\u201d\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

The Washington Post on Monday reported that subpoenas had gone out seeking information on those investors, some of whom weren\u2019t previously known to have been involved in the deal.\nBloomberg LP, which owns Bloomberg News, has invested in Andreessen Horowitz.\nAs the agreement between Musk and Twitter was coming together, Calacanis had canvassed his network of wealthy investors to solicit backing for the deal. \u201cWe are now collecting interest to invest in Twitter, with Elon Musk\u2019s plan to take it private,\u201d he wrote in a May 11 message seen by Bloomberg with the subject \u201cTwitter interest.\u201d He asked investors to get back to him that night.

He was spun around and thrown to the turf. While on the ground, his hands froze in front of his face. He remained down for more than seven minutes before being loaded on a backboard, stabilized and strapped to a stretcher after his facemask was removed.\nMedical staff tend to quarterback Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins after an injury during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paycor Stadium on Sept. 29, 2022 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Getty Images\nDolphins players gathered around as Tagovailoa was rolled off the field and the crowd chanted \"Tua! Tua!\"\nReaction came swiftly from around the NFL. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Broncos QB Russell Wilson promptly tweeted with concern for Tagovailoa's well-being.\n\"Praying for you Tua,\" Wilson wrote.\nThe 24-year-old Tagovailoa was suffering from a sore back and was listed as questionable for most of the week ahead of the game.\nTagovailoa briefly left Sunday's 21-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills after appearing to be disoriented by what the team originally said was a head injury after taking a hard hit from Bills linebacker Matt Milano late in the first half. He missed just three snaps and returned after halftime, a decision that prompted a joint review by the NFL and National Football League Players Association of what went into the decision to allow him to return to the game.\nThe team and Tagovailoa said after the game the quarterback had a back injury that caused his awkward stumble and fall after he was slammed into the turf in the second quarter. The team said Monday that Tagovailoa was not in concussion protocol.\nHe said he \"hyper-extended\" his back after getting his legs caught under someone on a quarterback sneak.\nBefore leaving Thursday's game, Tagovailoa was 8 for 14 for 100 yards and an interception. He was replaced in the game by Teddy Bridgewater, who threw a touchdown pass to Chase Edmonds with 15 seconds left in the half.\nThe play of Tagovailoa, who won a national championship at Alabama, has been key for the 3-0 Dolphins. He came into the game second in the NFL with 925 passing yards.",

In a statement, United said passengers alerted the crew to the snake, and the airline \u2018called the appropriate authorities to take care of the situation\u2019.\nThe Washington Times reported citing local media of New Jersey, News 12 New Jersey, that the passengers flying in business class spotted the snake while the plane was taxiing after landing.

The viral Tik Tok video from the flight showed that the reptile was inside a light fixture above passengers.

Obviously, we would have loved to find the young man a long time ago,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWould you please thoroughly check your locations so that we can be those eyes and ears and an extension of our resources?\u201d\nAbout 3:15 p.m., dozens of officers and other personnel formed a \u201cline search,\u201d Nix said, in which they gathered on the north side of the Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest and slowly walked toward its entrance to conduct a sweep of the area. Cadets from the Lowell Police Academy were also traversing across area properties earlier in the afternoon, looking under cars and in brush.\nOfficials continue to concentrate on the general area of the forest, but given how small and young the child is, it is a more intensive search.\nBy all accounts, police said it appears the child \u201cwalked away\u201d from the home. There are rumors that the child is \u201cnon-verbal\u201d or there is some language barrier, but Golner said there is no confirmation of that.\nNeighbors and nearby residents have cooperated with law enforcement as detectives conduct interviews and look for video, Golner said.\nAs far as leads on the investigation, Nix said officials are \u201cconsidering all levels of what might have transpired.\u201d There are no plans to issue an Amber Alert.\nAs of 9:30 p.m., police ceased the fuller search for the evening and planned to have officers remain in the neighborhood overnight and follow up on information they received during the day. The full complement is expected to return and resume the search for Harry early Wednesday morning.\nPolice used the reverse 911 system to notify residents of the area. Police urge anyone with information on Harry\u2019s whereabouts, or if they believe they have seen him, to immediately call 911 or Lowell Police at 978-937-3200.",

During the search, various incriminating documents and digital records were also seized, said the ED.\nThe ED said that the total movable assets were seized from an \"unexplained source\" and were \"found to be secreted\" in the raided premises. The assets were seized during a search operation carried out under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 at the premises of Satyendar Jain, his wife Poonam Jain, and his accomplices and other persons who had either directly or indirectly assisted him or participated in the processes of money laundering.\nThose who assisted the Delhi Minister in the money laundering are named as Ankush Jain, Vaibhav Jain, Naveen Jain and Siddharth Jain, G S Matharoo, Yogesh Kumar Jain, father-in-law of Ankush Jain and Lala Sher Singh Jivan Vigyan Trust, said the ED. The federal agency's separate teams had carried out the searches at six places in Delhi, including the residence of Jain, and one in Gurugram since morning.\nThe places raided by the ED across Delhi included Ram Prakash jewellers Pvt Ltd in southeast Delhi. The agency conducted raids after it arrested Jain on May 30 under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\nOn May 31, a trial court sent Jain to ED's custody till June 9. The move comes days after the federal agency arrested Jain on May 30. Jain is in the custody of ED till June 9.\nInvestigation revealed that one accomplice member of Lala Sher Singh Jivan Vigyan Trust had provided accommodation entries for the transfer of land from a company beneficially owned by Satyendar Jain to family members of accomplices in order to alienate the property and to frustrate the process of confiscation. The ED had initiated a money-laundering investigation on the basis of the First Information Report registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation on August 24, 2017, under Section 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against Satyendar Jain, Poonam Jain, Ajit Prasad Jain, Sunil Kumar Jain, Vaibhav Jain and Ankush Jain.\nThe CBI filed a chargesheet on December 3, 2018, against Satyendar Kumar Jain, Poonam Jain, Ajit Prasad Jain, Sunil Kumar Jain, Vaibhav Jain and Ankush Jain. The charge sheet mentions that Satyendar Jain while holding the office as a Minister in the Government of Delhi, during the period February 14, 2015, to May 31, 2017, had acquired assets which are disproportionate to his known sources of income.\nThe CBI has accused Satyendar Kumar Jain and others for the commission of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Jain was arrested after the ED in April this year attached immovable properties worth Rs 4.81 crore owned by companies named Akinchan Developers Pvt.

The suspect appeared in court wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white face mask, with his hands cuffed in front of him.\nHadi Matar, 24, center, arrives for an arraignment in the Chautauqua County Courthouse in Mayville, N.Y., Saturday, Aug. 13, 2022. Matar, who is accused of carrying out a stabbing attack against \u201cSatanic Verses\u201d author Salman Rushdie has entered a not-guilty plea.AP\nA judge ordered him held without bail after District Attorney Jason Schmidt told her Matar, 24, took steps to purposely put himself in position to harm Rushdie, getting an advance pass to the event where the author was speaking and arriving a day early bearing a fake ID.\n\u201cThis was a targeted, unprovoked, preplanned attack on Mr. Rushdie,\u201d Schmidt said.\nPublic defender Nathaniel Barone complained that authorities had taken too long to get Matar in front of a judge while leaving him \u201chooked up to a bench at the state police barracks.\u201d\n\u201cHe has that constitutional right of presumed innocence,\u201d Barone added.\nRushdie, 75, suffered a damaged liver and severed nerves in an arm and an eye, Wylie said Friday evening. He was likely to lose the injured eye.\nThe attack was met with shock and outrage from much of the world, along with tributes and praise for the award-winning author who for more than 30 years has faced death threats for \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d\nAuthor Salman Rushdie.Grant Pollard/Invision/AP\n\u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d drew death threats after it was published in 1988, with many Muslims regarding as blasphemy a dream sequence based on the life of the Prophet Muhammad, among other objections. Rushdie\u2019s book had already been banned and burned in India, Pakistan and elsewhere before Iran\u2019s Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death in 1989.\nInvestigators were working to determine whether the suspect, born a decade after \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published, acted alone.\nDistrict Attorney Schmidt alluded to the fatwa as a potential motive in arguing against bail.\n\u201cEven if this court were to set a million dollars bail, we stand a risk that bail could be met,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\u201cHis resources don\u2019t matter to me. We understand that the agenda that was carried out yesterday is something that was adopted and it\u2019s sanctioned by larger groups and organizations well beyond the jurisdictional borders of Chautauqua County,\u201d the prosecutor said.\nBarone, the public defender, said after the hearing that Matar has been communicating openly with him and that he would spend the coming weeks trying to learn about his client, including whether he has psychological or addiction issues.\nMatar is from Fairview, New Jersey. Rosaria Calabrese, manager of the State of Fitness Boxing Club, a small, tightly knit gym in nearby North Bergen, said Matar joined April 11 and participated in about 27 group sessions for beginners looking to improve their fitness before emailing her several days ago to say he wanted to cancel his membership because \u201che wouldn\u2019t be coming back for a while.\u201d",

Charges against the woman were dropped this year.\nDoe told The Times that when she allowed police to take her DNA sample, she had been assured that it would remain \u201cconfidential.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just traumatizing on so many levels, because I was going through something, and just like any other person would do, I contacted the police and thought they\u2019d do their job,\u201d Doe said. \u201cBut they overextended that and did something that was even more violating \u2014 something that broke my trust toward law enforcement, which nobody should feel.\u201d\nDoe\u2019s attorney, Adante Pointer, said the practice violated constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, adding that the Police Department may have misused hundreds if not thousands of victims\u2019 DNA in a similar manner. Since 2015, the department had stored crime victims\u2019 DNA samples without their consent or knowledge and even after their cases had been resolved, according to the lawsuit.\nOfficer Robert Rueca, a Police Department spokesperson, declined to comment on pending litigation but referred to a February news release from Chief Bill Scott.\nIn the release, Scott said the department would \u201cnever create disincentives for crime victims to cooperate with police.\u201d If DNA from a rape or sexual assault victim had been used to identify a suspect in another crime, Scott said at the time, he was \u201ccommitted to ending the practice.\u201d\nIn May, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to restrict city departments from storing DNA evidence from crime victims in any database not part of the national system for convicted offender and arrestee profiles. The ordinance also required the Police Department to purge any victim DNA samples that had been kept.\nState Sen. Scott Wiener introduced a bill in February that would ban law enforcement from using DNA gathered as part of sexual assault and rape examinations against victims.\nThe bill, SB 1228, was passed by the Legislature and is at Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk.\nJen Kwart, spokesperson for the San Francisco city attorney\u2019s office, said the city has not been served with Doe\u2019s complaint but would \u201crespond appropriately\u201d when that occurs.\n\u201cThe City is committed to ensuring all victims of crime feel comfortable reporting issues to law enforcement and has taken steps to safeguard victim information,\u201d she said in a statement.\nAfter Doe gave police DNA evidence in her sexual assault case, she said, she didn\u2019t want to testify in court. The case was eventually dropped, she said.\nDoe said what happened to her could deter other survivors of assault from coming forward.\n\u201cWhen it comes to sexual assault, it\u2019s a confusing and hard subject to talk about,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know how a turtle is scared in its shell and you poke at it and it goes back in. That\u2019s how I felt \u2014 closed in and in a dark hole.\u201d\nPointer said that although San Francisco \u201cgot caught with their hand in the cookie jar,\u201d other jurisdictions could still be misusing crime victims\u2019 DNA.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the most sacred thing to an individual person, which is their DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no safeguards that a person was aware this information was being assessed and used, and no safeguards on who they\u2019re sharing it with.\u201d",

The protocol, designed to preserve free trade on the island of Ireland, is part of the broader trade deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson negotiated with the European Union when Britain left the 27-nation bloc.\nBut the arrangement has proved politically damaging for Johnson because it treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom, potentially weakening the province\u2019s historic links with Britain.

Britain is trying to assert its newly won independence from the EU while preserving the union of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\nAfter a conversation with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said \u201cunilateral action is damaging to mutual trust and a formula for uncertainty.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s executive arm is expected to give a more detailed response once the U.K.\u2019s plans have been released.\nIreland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, also spoke with Truss on Monday and accused the U.K. government of deliberately ratcheting up \u201ctension with an EU seeking compromise.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Samuel Petrequin in Brussels contributed to this story.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Brexit at https://apnews.com/hub/brexit.",

The eight ex-employees have filed unfair labor practices charges with the National Labor Relations Board. They claim SpaceX retaliated against them for writing the letter and that their dismissals were illegal.\nA Thursday report in the New York Times revealed new details about what happened at SpaceX after the employees sent executives their open letter, which was drafted in the wake of a May story alleging Musk had exposed his genitals to a flight attendant and asked her for sex in exchange for a horse. Musk has denied the allegations, including the claim that SpaceX paid the flight attendant a $250,000 settlement to keep quiet.\nThe Times report illustrates how Musk-led companies are inextricably linked to his identity and highlights the billionaire\u2019s iron grip on how they\u2019re run. Furthermore, the report underscores how Musk deals with dissent at his companies, a topic of high public interest at the moment given his treatment of Twitter employees, some of whom he\u2019s firing via the social network they work on.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the outlet, shortly after SpaceX fired employees for their involvement in the letter, the company set up a meeting with a group of about 20 engineers.

The 27-year-old was born in the East Bay city of Vallejo, California, and attended Benicia High School.\n\u201cWe wish Willie the best in his opportunity with San Francisco,\u201d Rangers president Jon Daniels said. \"It\u2019s a fresh start for him, as well as being close to home.\u201d\nSan Francisco also receives cash in the deal.\nCalhoun has spent all five-plus years of his major league career with the Rangers, playing 253 games and hitting .241 overall. He had a .136 average with a homer and two RBIs over 18 big league games this year. Just more than a month after he was optioned to Triple-A, he was designated for assignment and cleared waivers before being assigned outright to Round Rock, where he hit .217 with five homers in 22 games.\nRight-hander Spencer Patton was designated for assignment by Texas to make room on its 40-man roster for Duggar, but the Giants didn't add Calhoun to their 40-man roster. Duggar, 28, was activated from the 60-day injured list and the Rangers will need to make another move to add him to their 26-man roster when he joins the team.\nThe Rangers got Calhoun, pitcher A.J. Alexy and infielder Brendon Davis when they traded Darvish, then a four-time All-Star for Texas, to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a deadline deal on July 31, 2017.\nCalhoun made his big league debut that September, hitting .265 with one homer and four RBIs in 13 games, then hit .222 in 35 games the next year. His best season with the Rangers was in 2019, when he hit .269 with 21 homers and 48 RBIs in 83 games.\nBut he suffered a broken jaw during spring training 2020 when hit by a pitch and played only 29 games in the season delayed and shortened by the pandemic. His 2021 season ended in June when he was hit by a pitch that fractured his left forearm.\nDuggar batted .194 with four RBIs in 12 games for the Giants this year before being placed on the injured list April 22 because of a left oblique strain.\nDaniels described Duggar as \u201ca strong all-around baseball player who can add value to the team in a variety of ways.\u201d His skill set is similar to speedy outfielder Eli White, who is on the 60-day IL with a right wrist fracture from an outfield collision on June 12.\nWhite and Duggar were teammates at Clemson for two seasons before the Giants took Duggar in the sixth round of the 2015 amateur draft.\nDuggar has made big league appearances with San Francisco in each season since his debut in 2017. He has hit .242 with 14 homers, 87 RBIs and 18 stolen bases in his 254 MLB games. He has started at all three outfield positions, primarily in center.\n___\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley contributed to this report from San Francisco.\n___\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

Pic/iStock\nAn anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has awarded over 15 years jail term in a terror financing case to a main handler of deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\"An anti-terrorism court in Lahore early this month had handed down over 15 years jail term to Sajid Majeed Mir, an activist of banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, on a terror financing case,\" a senior lawyer associated with terror financing cases of LeT and Jamaat-ud-Dawa leaders told PTI on Friday.\nThe Counter Terrorism Department of the Punjab Police, which often issues conviction of the suspects in such cases to the media, did not notify Mir's conviction in a terror financing case. Besides, since it was an in-camera proceeding at jail, the media was not allowed. The lawyer further said convict Mir, who is in mid 40s, has been in the Kot Lakhpat jail since his arrest in this April. He said the court also imposed a fine of over Rs 400,000 to the convict. Earlier, it was assumed that Mir was dead.\nAlso read: Mumbai: 18 live bullets found in sea near Juhu beach\nBefore the last meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, Pakistan reportedly told the agency that it had arrested and prosecuted Sajid Mir in order to seek its removal from the FATF 'Grey list'. Sajid Mir, who has a bounty of USD 5 Million is in India's most wanted list for his role in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks that left 166 people dead. Mir was called \"project manager\" of the Mumbai attacks. Mir reportedly had visited India in 2005 using a fake passport in a fake name. Mumbai terror attacks alleged mastermind and JuD chief Hafiz Saeed has already been sentenced for 68 years imprisonment in terror financing cases by the Lahore ATC. The sentence is running concurrently, which means he will not have to spend many years in jail. Mumbai attack operation commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi is also convicted for several years in jail. Both Saeed and Maki are also in Kot Lapkhapt jail in Lahore.\nSaeed, a UN-designated terrorist on whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty, was arrested on July 2019 in the terror financing cases. Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Toiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that also left six Americans dead. The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force is instrumental in pushing Islamabad to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India. The FATF had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering.\nThis story has been sourced from a third party syndicated feed, agencies.

I am most grateful to them. But having considered the matter deeply I see that the Opposition's candidate should be one who will generate a national consensus and a national atmosphere beside Opposition unity. I feel there will be others who will do this far better than I.

This was thought so after Sharad Pawar and Farooq Abdullah declined the offer to contest for the top post.\nThe Opposition parties are slated to meet tomorrow at 2.30 pm to hold a second round of meeting on the Presidential Election issue. Pawar will chair tomorrow's meeting after the first meeting was presided over by TMC's Mamata Banerjee.

Recounting his long association with the Congress, Azad had said the situation in the party has reached a point of \"no return.\"\nWhile Azad took potshots at Sonia Gandhi in the letter, his sharpest attack was on Rahul Gandhi and he described the Wayand MP as a \"non-serious individual\" and \"immature\".",
