He was detained by bystanders and handed over to the authorities.\\n\"It is too early to speculate\" about what caused the incident, an Interior Ministry spokesman told a regular federal government news conference in Berlin. Police said it was not yet clear whether it was an accident or a deliberate act.\\nGermany\\'s Bild newspaper said the person killed was a teacher who had been with a group of her schoolchildren in the street near the war-ravaged Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, one of the German capital\\'s best-known landmarks.\\nMore than a dozen people were injured, a police spokesman at the scene in western Berlin said. Six were in a life-threatening condition, and another three were seriously hurt, the fire service said.\\nInvestigators were looking into whether the incident was a deliberate attack or possibly an accident with a medical cause, a police spokesman said, adding that the driver had received some medical treatment.\\nBild newspaper released a picture of the driver being detained, wearing a yellow pullover, jogging trousers and red trainers.\\nThe small silver Renault car was lodged inside a shop after smashing through a plate glass display.\\nPlacards relating to Turkey were discovered in the car but there was no letter of confession, the city\\'s state Interior Minister Iris Spranger said, refuting an earlier media report from Bild.\\nBlankets covered what appeared to be a body in a cordoned-off area guarded by police. Rescue workers moved apparently conscious people on stretchers towards an ambulance, including one woman sitting up, and another who covered her face with her hand.\\nMr Frank Vittchen, a witness at the scene, told Agence France-Presse he was sitting at a fountain nearby when he \"heard a big crash and then also saw a person fly through the air\".\\nThe vehicle drove \"at high speed onto the pavement and didn\\'t brake\", he said, with its windows shattering from the impact.\\n\"It all happened so fast,\" he said.\\nAnother witness who declined to be named said the people hit by the car included a group of 15-to 16-year-olds, and that two teachers were among those injured.\\nBritish-American actor John Barrowman posted a series of videos on Twitter from the scene.\\n\"I heard the bang and the crash when we were in a store and then we came out and we just saw the carnage,\" he said.\\nThe site, on a shopping street near a McDonald\\'s restaurant, was cordoned off.
